            "A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.\n",
            "Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Prior to the invention of computers, programs were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).\n",
            "The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common. \n",
            "Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Definitions\n",
            "A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm. Some authors restrict the term \"programming language\" to those languages that can express all possible algorithms. Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include:\n",
            "\n",
            "Function and target\n",
            "A computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer performing some kind of computation or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk drives, robots, and so on. For example, PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language. In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way. Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.\n",
            "Abstractions\n",
            "Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle. This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.\n",
            "Expressive power\n",
            "The theory of computation classifies languages by the computations they are capable of expressing. All Turing-complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called programming languages.Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which define structured data, are not usually considered programming languages. Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined. XSLT, for example, is a Turing complete language entirely using XML syntax. Moreover, LaTeX, which is mostly used for structuring documents, also contains a Turing complete subset.The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language. However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages. Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines, and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources. John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.\n",
            "\n",
            "History\n",
            "Early developments\n",
            "Very early computers, such as Colossus, were programmed without the help of a stored program, by modifying their circuitry or setting banks of physical controls.\n",
            "Slightly later, programs could be written in machine language, where the programmer writes each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly. For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory locations might consist of 3 numbers: an \"opcode\" that selects the \"add\" operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from punched cards, paper tape, magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer.  Machine languages were later termed first-generation programming languages (1GL).\n",
            "The next step was the development of the so-called second-generation programming languages (2GL) or assembly languages, which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.\n",
            "The first high-level programming languages, or third-generation programming languages (3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalkül, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer. Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.\n",
            "At the University of Manchester, Alick Glennie developed Autocode in the early 1950s. As a programming language, it used a compiler to automatically convert the language into machine code. The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first compiled high-level programming language.The second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker in 1954 and was called the \"Mark 1 Autocode\". Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by D. F. Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine.\n",
            "In 1954, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by John Backus. It was the first widely used high-level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper. It is still a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype. The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959. FLOW-MATIC was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Refinement\n",
            "The increased use of high-level languages introduced a requirement for low-level programming languages or system programming languages. These languages, to varying degrees, provide facilities between assembly languages and high-level languages. They can be used to perform tasks that require direct access to hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures and error-checking.\n",
            "The period from the 1960s to the late 1970s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in use:\n",
            "\n",
            "APL introduced array programming and influenced functional programming.\n",
            "ALGOL refined both structured procedural programming and the discipline of language specification; the \"Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60\" became a model for how later language specifications were written.\n",
            "Lisp, implemented in 1958, was the first dynamically typed functional programming language.\n",
            "In the 1960s, Simula was the first language designed to support object-oriented programming; in the mid-1970s, Smalltalk followed with the first \"purely\" object-oriented language.\n",
            "C was developed between 1969 and 1973 as a system programming language for the Unix operating system and remains popular.\n",
            "Prolog, designed in 1972, was the first logic programming language.\n",
            "In 1978, ML built a polymorphic type system on top of Lisp, pioneering statically typed functional programming languages.Each of these languages spawned descendants, and most modern programming languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.\n",
            "The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of structured programming, and whether programming languages should be designed to support it. Edsger Dijkstra, in a famous 1968 letter published in the Communications of the ACM, argued that Goto statements should be eliminated from all \"higher level\" programming languages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consolidation and growth\n",
            "The 1980s were years of relative consolidation. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language derived from Pascal and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating the so-called \"fifth-generation\" languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.\n",
            "One important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of modules or large-scale organizational units of code. Modula-2, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded to generic programming constructs.The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages. Perl, originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic websites. Java came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of \"Write once, run anywhere\" (UCSD Pascal had been popular for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not fundamentally novel; rather, they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languages).\n",
            "Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity (mixins, delegates, aspects), and database integration such as Microsoft's LINQ.\n",
            "Fourth-generation programming languages (4GL) are computer programming languages that aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs. Fifth-generation programming languages (5GL) are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elements\n",
            "All programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "Syntax\n",
            "A programming language's surface form is known as its syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.\n",
            "The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.\n",
            "Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions (for lexical structure) and Backus–Naur form (for grammatical structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on Lisp:\n",
            "\n",
            "This grammar specifies the following:\n",
            "\n",
            "an expression is either an atom or a list;\n",
            "an atom is either a number or a symbol;\n",
            "a number is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;\n",
            "a symbol is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and\n",
            "a list is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more expressions inside it.The following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: 12345, () and (a b c232 (1)).\n",
            "Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit undefined behavior. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.\n",
            "Using natural language as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.\" is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.\n",
            "\"John is a married bachelor.\" is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.The following C language fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation *p >> 4 has no meaning for a value having a complex type and p->im is not defined because the value of p is the null pointer):\n",
            "\n",
            "If the type declaration on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable p during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.\n",
            "The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the Chomsky hierarchy. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are context-free grammars. Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase. Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem, and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution. In contrast to Lisp's macro system and Perl's BEGIN blocks, which may contain general computations, C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution.\n",
            "\n",
            "Semantics\n",
            "The term semantics refers to the meaning of languages, as opposed to their form (syntax).\n",
            "\n",
            "Static semantics\n",
            "The static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms. For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every identifier is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a case statement are distinct. Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a logic called a type system. Other forms of static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like Java and C# have definite assignment analysis, a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dynamic semantics\n",
            "Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which control structures conditionally execute statements. The dynamic semantics (also known as execution semantics) of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into formal semantics of programming languages, which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.\n",
            "\n",
            "Type system\n",
            "A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types, how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any decidable type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have type loopholes, usually unchecked casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to type check programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, infer types, relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as type theory.\n",

            "Typed versus untyped languages\n",
            "A language is typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable. For example, the data represented by \"this text between the quotes\" is a string, and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled (\"static\" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected while the program is running (\"dynamic\" type checking), resulting in a run-time exception. Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to handle this exception and, for example, always return \"-1\" as the result.\n",
            "A special case of typed languages are the single-typed languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as REXX or SGML, and have only one data type–—most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data.\n",
            "In contrast, an untyped language, such as most assembly languages, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths. High-level untyped languages include BCPL, Tcl, and some varieties of Forth.\n",
            "In practice, while few languages are considered typed from the type theory (verifying or rejecting all operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing. Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type-safety for finer control over the program's execution (see casting).\n",
            "\n",
            "Static vis-à-vis dynamic typing\n",
            "In static typing, all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.Statically typed languages can be either manifestly typed or type-inferred. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable declarations). In the second case, the compiler infers the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as C++, C# and Java, are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as Haskell and ML. However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, C++, Java and C# all infer types in certain limited cases. Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float.\n",
            "Dynamic typing, also called latent typing, determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with run-time values rather than textual expressions. As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type errors cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making debugging more difficult. Lisp, Smalltalk, Perl, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are all examples of dynamically typed languages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Weak and strong typing\n",
            "Weak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a string as a number. This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at compile time and even at run time.\n",
            "Strong typing prevents these program faults. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error. Strongly typed languages are often termed type-safe or safe.\n",
            "An alternative definition for \"weakly typed\" refers to languages, such as Perl and JavaScript, which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression 2 * x implicitly converts x to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if x is null, undefined, an Array, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.\n",
            "Strong and static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term strongly typed to mean strongly, statically typed, or, even more confusingly, to mean simply statically typed. Thus C has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.It may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be \"weakly, statically typed\". However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the void* pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as (int) or (char).\n",
            "\n",
            "Standard library and run-time system\n",
            "Most programming languages have an associated core library (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.\n",
            "The line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in Java, a string literal is defined as an instance of the java.lang.String class; similarly, in Smalltalk, an anonymous function expression (a \"block\") constructs an instance of the library's BlockContext class. Conversely, Scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.\n",
            "\n",
            "Design and implementation\n",
            "Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing language families of related languages branching one from another. But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage. A significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety since it has a precise and finite definition. By contrast, natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities. While constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.\n",
            "Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one \"universal\" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role. The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:\n",
            "\n",
            "Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmers.\n",
            "Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.\n",
            "Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers to supercomputers.\n",
            "Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.\n",
            "Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of abstraction. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit.\n",
            "Natural language programming has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate. Edsger W. Dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs, and dismissed natural language programming as \"foolish\". Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea. Hybrid approaches have been taken in Structured English and SQL.\n",
            "A language's designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming. The most important of these artifacts are the language specification and implementation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Specification\n",
            "The specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be.\n",
            "A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:\n",
            "\n",
            "An explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language. While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in natural language (e.g., as in the C language), or a formal semantics (e.g., as in Standard ML and Scheme specifications).\n",
            "A description of the behavior of a translator for the language (e.g., the C++ and Fortran specifications). The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or a formal language.\n",
            "A reference or model implementation, sometimes written in the language being specified (e.g., Prolog or ANSI REXX). The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Implementation\n",
            "An implementation of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: compilation and interpretation. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique.\n",
            "The output of a compiler may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of BASIC compile and then execute the source a line at a time.\n",
            "Programs that are executed directly on the hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software.One technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is just-in-time compilation. Here the virtual machine, just before execution, translates the blocks of bytecode which are going to be used to machine code, for direct execution on the hardware.\n",
            "\n",
            "Proprietary languages\n",
            "Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain specific languages or internal scripting languages for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.\n",
            "Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, Oracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming language, and Microsoft's C# programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has Common Language Runtime (CLR) as a closed environment.Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include MATLAB, VBScript, and Wolfram Language.  Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, Erlang was originally an Ericsson's internal programming language.\n",
            "\n",
            "Use\n",
            "Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field.\n",
            "Individual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more.Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers \"do exactly what they are told to do\", and cannot \"understand\" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.\n",
            "A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called primitives). Programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.\n",
            "Programs for a computer might be executed in a batch process without human interaction, or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case the \"commands\" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a Unix shell or other command-line interface), without compiling, it is called a scripting language.\n",
            "\n",
            "Measuring language usage\n",
            "Determining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large mainframes; Fortran in scientific and engineering applications; Ada in aerospace, transportation, military, real-time and embedded applications; and C in embedded applications and operating systems. Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.\n",
            "Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:\n",
            "\n",
            "counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language\n",
            "the number of books sold that teach or describe the language\n",
            "estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language –  which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches\n",
            "counts of language references (i.e., to the name of the language) found using a web search engine.Combining and averaging information from various internet sites, stackify.com reported the ten most popular programming languages as (in descending order by overall popularity): Java, C, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, VB .NET, R, PHP, and MATLAB.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dialects, flavors and implementations\n",
            "A dialect of a programming language or a data exchange language is a (relatively small) variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature. With languages such as Scheme and Forth, standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new dialect. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a domain-specific language, often a subset. In the Lisp world, most languages that use basic S-expression syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, Racket and Clojure. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The BASIC programming language has many dialects.\n",
            "\n",
            "Taxonomies\n",
            "There is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.\n",
            "The task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple threads in parallel). Python is an object-oriented scripting language.\n",
            "In broad strokes, programming languages divide into programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use, with general-purpose programming languages distinguished from domain-specific programming languages. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called imperative programming languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of declarative programming. More refined paradigms include procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and logic programming; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, system programming languages, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these). Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals.A programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm. For instance, most programming languages use English language keywords, while a minority do not. Other languages may be classified as being deliberately esoteric or not.\n",

It is available for many platforms, including Windows (starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8;[125][126] Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS.[127] Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities,[128] during the Python 1 and Python 2 time-frame, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported;[129] support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms.\n",

              "'Python (programming language) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30] Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31] Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33] Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[34][35][36][37] History Python was conceived in the late 1980s[38] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[39] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its implementation began in December 1989.[40] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python\\'s \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker.[41] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member \"Steering Council\" to lead the project.[42][43] Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.[44] Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[45] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[46] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[47] Python 2.7\\'s end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[48][49] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[50][51] With Python 2\\'s end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[52] and later are supported. Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[53] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[54]) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution[55] and web cache poisoning.[56] Design philosophy and features Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[57] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[58] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[59][60] and logic programming.[61] Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[62] It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution. Python\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[63] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[64] The language\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[65] Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts. Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[38] It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[66] Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl\\'s \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[65] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that \"To describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[67] Python\\'s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[68] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter. Python\\'s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[69]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[70][71] A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[72][73] Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.[74][75] Syntax and semantics Main article: Python syntax and semantics Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[76] Indentation Main article: Python syntax and semantics § Indentation Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[77] Thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents the program\\'s semantic structure.[78] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[79] Statements and control flow Python\\'s statements include (among others): The assignment statement, using a single equals sign =. The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if). The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception. The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming. يبلميبةملنةيمبنلةيمنبةلمنيب يبل ينمبةل يمبنةل 0يب . يبلمويلك The def statement, which defines a function or method. The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[80] The break statement, exits from a loop. The continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. The del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned. The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines. The return statement, used to return a value from a function. The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. The assignment statement (=) operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. However, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. This is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically-typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[81][82] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided, by extending Python\\'s generators.[83] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[84] Expressions Some Python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as C and Java, while some are not: Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[85] Python also uses the ** operator for exponentiation. From Python 3.5, the new infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[86][87] From Python 3.8, the syntax :=, called the \\'walrus operator\\' was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[88] In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value[89] and objects by reference.[90] (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) Python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c. Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C. Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression.[63] Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y[91] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages). Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[92] Python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[93] Python has a \"string format\" operator %. This functions analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": blah = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}\\'.[94] Strings in Python can be concatenated, by \"adding\" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). E.g. \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. E.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\". Python has various kinds of string literals: Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[94] Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby. Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare in C#. Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy. In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example: List comprehensions vs. for-loops Conditional expressions vs. if blocks The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python. Methods Methods on objects are functions attached to the object\\'s class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).[95] Apart from this, Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more.[96] Typing Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically-typed, Python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection. Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[97] The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0. The long-term plan is to support gradual typing[98] and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.[99] Arithmetic operations Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator .[103] These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively). The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[104] Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5. Python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. The floor division // operator was introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next). Python 2.1 and earlier used C\\'s division behavior. The / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -2. In Python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[104] Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[105] Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[106] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[107] Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[108] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[109] Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[110] The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[111] Due to Python\\'s extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[112][113] Programming examples Hello world program: print(\\'Hello, world!\\') Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer: n = int(input(\\'Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: \\')) if n < 0: raise ValueError(\\'You must enter a non-negative integer\\') factorial = 1 for i in range(2, n + 1): factorial *= i print(factorial) Libraries Python\\'s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,[114] provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[115] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333[116]), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. As of September 2021, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 329,000[117] packages with a wide range of functionality, including: Automation Data analytics Databases Documentation Graphical user interfaces Image processing Machine learning Mobile App Multimedia Computer networking Scientific computing System administration Test frameworks Text processing Web frameworks Web scraping Development environments See also: Comparison of integrated development environments § Python Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs; SageMath (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.[118] نيوبملمينبل Implementations See also: List of Python software § Python implementations Reference implementation CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard with several select C99 features (with later C versions out, it\\'s considered outdated;[119][120] CPython includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions, can e.g. be implemented with C11 or C++[121]).[122] It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode[123] which is then executed by its virtual machine.[124] CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including Windows (starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8;[125][126] Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS.[127] Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities,[128] during the Python 1 and Python 2 time-frame, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported;[129] support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. Other implementations PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.6.[130] Its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython but several libraries written in C cannot be used with it.[131] Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.[132] MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including Lego Mindstorms EV3.[133] Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs.[134] Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT and an experimental bytecode compiler.[135] Unsupported implementations Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported: Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores,[136] while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. Psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later. PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones released by Nokia in 2005. It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.[137] Cross-compilers to other languages There are several compilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language: Cython compiles (a superset of) Python 2.7 to C (while the resulting code is also usable with Python 3 and also e.g. C++). Nuitka compiles Python into C++.[138] Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++.[139][140][141] Pyrex (latest release in 2010) and Shed Skin (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively. Google\\'s Grumpy (latest release in 2017) transpiles Python 2 to Go.[142][143][144] IronPython (now abandoned by Microsoft) allows running Python 2.7 programs on the .NET Common Language Runtime.[145] Jython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program.[146] MyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL), that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code. Numba uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python to machine code. Brython,[147] Transcrypt[148][149] and Pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile Python to JavaScript. RPython can be compiled to C, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python. Performance A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy \\'13.[150] Python\\'s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.[151] Development Python\\'s development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions.[152] Python coding style is covered in PEP 8.[153] Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.[152] Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. Specific issues are discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org.[154] Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.[155] CPython\\'s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented: Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. Major or \"feature\" releases, occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with Python 3.9 are expected to happen once a year.[156][157] They are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.[158] Bugfix releases,[159] which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.[159] Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.[160] The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as Pyladies. Python 3.10 deprecates wstr (to be removed in Python 3.12; meaning Python extensions[161] need to be modified by then),[162] and also plans to add pattern matching to the language.[163] API documentation generators Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc (available as part of standard library), Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others.[164] Naming Python\\'s name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;[165] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar.[165][166] The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.[167][168] The prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python. Popularity Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, as of February 2021, it is the third most popular language (behind Java, and C).[169] It was selected Programming Language of the Year (for \"the highest rise in ratings in a year\") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times[170]).[171] An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often \"better than Java and not much worse than C or C++\".[172] Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google,[173] Yahoo!,[174] CERN,[175] NASA,[176] Facebook,[177] Amazon, Instagram,[178] Spotify[179] and some smaller entities like ILM[180] and ITA.[181] The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python.[182] _________________________________________ stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog Here\\'s a collection of resources on how to get started using Python. Getting started with… Python In this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the Stack Overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. Up now, #3 on our list: Python. Python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our Developer Survey. In 2020, 66.7% of respondents said they want to keep working with Python. Conceived in the late 80s, it’s one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers Rust (2010) and TypeScript (2012)—evidence that original designer Guido van Rossum got a lot right. Python’s quirky name—in honor of the cult comedy show, Monty Python—belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. While it’s not primarily used for performance-intensive programming, it’s often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. This makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it’s used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to VFX and AI. Some regard it as an ideal language for beginners: many terms are expressed using English words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in Python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. History of use Trending tags on Stackoverflow.com Although Python has been around since the 1.0 release in 1991, its usage has ballooned in recent years. Indeed, as our former data scientist David Robinson noted, since 2012, it has risen above the five other major languages (C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript and C#) in usage as estimated by the number of Stack Overflow question views per month. TIOBE’s 2021 index ranks Python as third in popularity at 10.86%, rapidly gaining on C and Java (16.34% and 11.29% respectively). Today, 44 % of developers and technologists around the world are using Python. Until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person—Dutch computer scientist Guido van Rossum, who stepped down as Python’s “Benevolent Dictator For Life” in 2018 but has remained an active contributor to this day. Who is using it? Python is more or less ubiquitous—it would be faster to list industries that don’t use it in some form. While it’s not the language of choice for consumer applications like 3D games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use Python for tools and utilities. It is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes—for example, in the VFX field, nearly all of the major software packages (Maya, 3Ds Max, Houdini, Cinema 4D, Blender, and Nuke) have embedded Python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. It’s used more or less everywhere on Earth and, well, even on Mars. In fact, if you’re reading this on a Mac, you already have Python installed on your computer—just go to Terminal, type ‘python’, and away you go… Who is it for? Students The use of short English keywords instead of symbols makes Python particularly friendly for beginners. See the example below. Additionally, Python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you’ll spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like C++. It comes bundled with a free IDE (integrated development environment), IDLE, so you can get started quickly. In case you’re wondering, yes, IDLE is a reference to Monty Python’s Eric Idle—if you use Python you’re going to be bombarded with references to vintage British comedy. Developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed While Python typically runs slower than other common languages like C++ or Java, it’s often much quicker to write—indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in Python is three to five times shorter than its Java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the C++ version. This is one of the reasons it’s often used as a “support language”—software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. For the same reason, it’s also used for prototyping—code can be “hacked together” quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. Developers working with text or numbers Python’s powerful String and List manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. And it’s a great tool for exploring data. The fact that it doesn’t need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running Python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step-by-step, examining it at each stage. Python’s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of ‘packages’, many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. These include the venerable NumPy (mathematical functions and data analysis), SciPy (for science), Matplotlib (data visualization) and Pandas (data analysis), and more recently TensorFlow and Keras (Machine Learning/AI), as well as tens of thousands of others. Web developers Another key area of Python use is backend development. It has built-in support for common protocols like HTML, XML, and JSON, and frameworks like Django, Flask, and Bottle are used widely—for example, Reddit’s backend is Python. Python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. Why you shouldn’t learn it There’s a lot to like about Python, but it’s not always the perfect tool for the job. Perhaps most importantly, Python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like C++. While that means there’s no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. So you’re probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster 60FPS first-person shooter in Python, but it’s perfect for situations like data manipulation where you’re likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. Additionally, Python’s somewhat unusual syntax means that—if it’s your first language—not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. For example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of English words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in Python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in Java or C++. However, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity. Key concepts The core philosophies are summarized—in Pythonic fashion—in “The Zen Of Python.” These include: “Readability counts Simple is better than complex There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it” In case you were wondering, The Zen Of Python is available in catchy musical form here.

              "'Python (programming language) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30] Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31] Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33] Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[34][35][36][37] History Python was conceived in the late 1980s[38] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[39] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its implementation began in December 1989.[40] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python\\'s \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker.[41] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member \"Steering Council\" to lead the project.[42][43] Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.[44] Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[45] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[46] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[47] Python 2.7\\'s end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[48][49] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[50][51] With Python 2\\'s end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[52] and later are supported. Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[53] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[54]) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution[55] and web cache poisoning.[56] Design philosophy and features Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[57] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[58] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[59][60] and logic programming.[61] Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[62] It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution. Python\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[63] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[64] The language\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[65] Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts. Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[38] It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[66] Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl\\'s \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[65] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that \"To describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[67] Python\\'s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[68] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter. Python\\'s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[69]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[70][71] A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[72][73] Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.[74][75] Syntax and semantics Main article: Python syntax and semantics Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[76] Indentation Main article: Python syntax and semantics § Indentation Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[77] Thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents the program\\'s semantic structure.[78] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[79] Statements and control flow Python\\'s statements include (among others): The assignment statement, using a single equals sign =. The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if). The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception. The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming. يبلميبةملنةيمبنلةيمنبةلمنيب يبل ينمبةل يمبنةل 0يب . يبلمويلك The def statement, which defines a function or method. The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[80] The break statement, exits from a loop. The continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. The del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will because an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned. The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines. The return statement, used to return a value from a function. The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. The assignment statement (=) operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. However, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. This is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically-typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[81][82] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided, by extending Python\\'s generators.[83] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[84] Expressions Some Python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as C and Java, while some are not: Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[85] Python also uses the ** operator for exponentiation. From Python 3.5, the new infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[86][87] From Python 3.8, the syntax :=, called the \\'walrus operator\\' was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[88] In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value[89] and objects by reference.[90] (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) Python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c. Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C. Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression.[63] Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y[91] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages). Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[92] Python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[93] Python has a \"string format\" operator %. This functions analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": blah = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}\\'.[94] Strings in Python can be concatenated, by \"adding\" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). E.g. \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. E.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\". Python has various kinds of string literals: Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[94] Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby. Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare in C#. Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy. In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example: List comprehensions vs. for-loops Conditional expressions vs. if blocks The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python. Methods Methods on objects are functions attached to the object\\'s class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).[95] Apart from this, Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more.[96] Typing Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically-typed, Python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection. Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[97] The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0. The long-term plan is to support gradual typing[98] and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.[99] Arithmetic operations Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator .[103] These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively). The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[104] Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5. Python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. The floor division // operator was introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next). Python 2.1 and earlier used C\\'s division behavior. The / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -2. In Python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[104] Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[105] Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[106] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[107] Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[108] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[109] Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[110] The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[111] Due to Python\\'s extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[112][113] Programming examples Hello world program: print(\\'Hello, world!\\') Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer: n = int(input(\\'Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: \\')) if n < 0: raise ValueError(\\'You must enter a non-negative integer\\') factorial = 1 for i in range(2, n + 1): factorial *= i print(factorial) Libraries Python\\'s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,[114] provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[115] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333[116]), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. As of September 2021, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 329,000[117] packages with a wide range of functionality, including: Automation Data analytics Databases Documentation Graphical user interfaces Image processing Machine learning Mobile App Multimedia Computer networking Scientific computing System administration Test frameworks Text processing Web frameworks Web scraping Development environments See also: Comparison of integrated development environments § Python Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs; SageMath (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.[118] نيوبملمينبل Implementations See also: List of Python software § Python implementations Reference implementation CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard with several select C99 features (with later C versions out, it is considered outdated;[119][120] CPython includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions, can e.g. be implemented with C11 or C++[121]).[122] It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode[123] which is then executed by its virtual machine.[124] CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including Windows (starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8;[125][126] Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS.[127] Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities,[128] during the Python 1 and Python 2 time-frame, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported;[129] support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. Other implementations PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.6.[130] Its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython but several libraries written in C cannot be used with it.[131] Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.[132] MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including Lego Mindstorms EV3.[133] Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs.[134] Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT and an experimental bytecode compiler.[135] Unsupported implementations Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported: Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores,[136] while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. Psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later. PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones released by Nokia in 2005. It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.[137] Cross-compilers to other languages There are several compilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language: Cython compiles (a superset of) Python 2.7 to C (while the resulting code is also usable with Python 3 and also e.g. C++). Nuitka compiles Python into C++.[138] Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++.[139][140][141] Pyrex (latest release in 2010) and She Would Skin (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively. Google\\'s Grumpy (latest release in 2017) transpiles Python 2 to Go.[142][143][144] IronPython (now abandoned by Microsoft) allows running Python 2.7 programs on the .NET Common Language Runtime.[145] Jython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program.[146] MyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL), that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code. Numba uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python to machine code. Brython,[147] Transcrypt[148][149] and Pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile Python to JavaScript. RPython can be compiled to C, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python. Performance A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy \\'13.[150] Python\\'s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.[151] Development Python\\'s development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions.[152] Python coding style is covered in PEP 8.[153] Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.[152] Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. Specific issues are discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org.[154] Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.[155] CPython\\'s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented: Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. Major or \"feature\" releases, occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with Python 3.9 are expected to happen once a year.[156][157] They are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.[158] Bugfix releases,[159] which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.[159] Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.[160] The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as Pyladies. Python 3.10 deprecates wstr (to be removed in Python 3.12; meaning Python extensions[161] need to be modified by then),[162] and also plans to add pattern matching to the language.[163] API documentation generators Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc (available as part of standard library), Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others.[164] Naming Python\\'s name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;[165] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar.[165][166] The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.[167][168] The prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python. Popularity Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, as of February 2021, it is the third most popular language (behind Java, and C).[169] It was selected Programming Language of the Year (for \"the highest rise in ratings in a year\") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times[170]).[171] An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often \"better than Java and not much worse than C or C++\".[172] Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google,[173] Yahoo!,[174] CERN,[175] NASA,[176] Facebook,[177] Amazon, Instagram,[178] Spotify[179] and some smaller entities like ILM[180] and ITA.[181] The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python.[182] _________________________________________ stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog Here is a collection of resources on how to get started using Python. Getting started with… Python In this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the Stack Overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. Up now, #3 on our list: Python. Python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our Developer Survey. In 2020, 66.7% of respondents said they want to keep working with Python. Conceived in the late 80s, it is one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers Rust (2010) and TypeScript (2012)—evidence that original designer Guido van Rossum got a lot right. Python’s quirky name—in honor of the cult comedy show, Monty Python—belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. While it is not primarily used for performance-intensive programming, it is often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. This makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it is used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to VFX and AI. Some regard it as an ideal language for beginners: many terms are expressed using English words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in Python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. History of use Trending tags on Stackoverflow.com Although Python has been around since the 1.0 release in 1991, its usage has ballooned in recent years. Indeed, as our former data scientist David Robinson noted, since 2012, it has risen above the five other major languages (C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript and C#) in usage as estimated by the number of Stack Overflow question views per month. TIOBE’s 2021 index ranks Python as third in popularity at 10.86%, rapidly gaining on C and Java (16.34% and 11.29% respectively). Today, 44 % of developers and technologists around the world are using Python. Until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person—Dutch computer scientist Guido van Rossum, who stepped down as Python’s “Benevolent Dictator For Life” in 2018 but has remained an active contributor to this day. Who is using it? Python is more or less ubiquitous—it would be faster to list industries that do not use it in some form. While it is not the language of choice for consumer applications like 3D games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use Python for tools and utilities. It is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes—for example, in the VFX field, nearly all of the major software packages (Maya, 3Ds Max, Houdini, Cinema 4D, Blender, and Nuke) have embedded Python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. It is used more or less everywhere on Earth and, well, even on Mars. In fact, if you are reading this on a Mac, you already have Python installed on your computer—just go to Terminal, type ‘python’, and away you go… Who is it for? Students The use of short English keywords instead of symbols makes Python particularly friendly for beginners. See the example below. Additionally, Python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you will spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like C++. It comes bundled with a free IDE (integrated development environment), IDLE, so you can get started quickly. In case you are wondering, yes, IDLE is a reference to Monty Python’s Eric Idle—if you use Python you are going to be bombarded with references to vintage British comedy. Developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed While Python typically runs slower than other common languages like C++ or Java, it is often much quicker to write—indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in Python is three to five times shorter than its Java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the C++ version. This is one of the reasons it is often used as a “support language”—software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. For the same reason, it is also used for prototyping—code can be “hacked together” quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. Developers working with text or numbers Python’s powerful String and List manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. And it is a great tool for exploring data. The fact that it does not need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running Python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step-by-step, examining it at each stage. Python’s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of ‘packages’, many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. These include the venerable NumPy (mathematical functions and data analysis), SciPy (for science), Matplotlib (data visualization) and Pandas (data analysis), and more recently TensorFlow and Keras (Machine Learning/AI), as well as tens of thousands of others. Web developers Another key area of Python use is backend development. It has built-in support for common protocols like HTML, XML, and JSON, and frameworks like Django, Flask, and Bottle are used widely—for example, Reddit’s backend is Python. Python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. Why you should not learn it There is a lot to like about Python, but it is not always the perfect tool for the job. Perhaps most importantly, Python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like C++. While that means there is no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. So you are probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster 60FPS first-person shooter in Python, but it is perfect for situations like data manipulation where you are likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. Additionally, Python’s somewhat unusual syntax means that—if it is your first language—not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. For example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of English words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in Python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in Java or C++. However, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity. Key concepts The core philosophies are summarized—in Pythonic fashion—in “The Zen Of Python.” These include: “Readability counts Simple is better than complex There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it” In case you were wondering, The Zen Of Python is available in catchy musical form here.

              "'python programming language from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia python is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large scale projects. python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured particularly, procedural , object oriented and functional programming. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. guido van rossum began working on python in the late s, as a successor to the abc programming language, and first released it in as python . . . python . was released in and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. python . was released in and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. python was discontinued with version . . in . python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. history python was conceived in the late s by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde informatica cwi in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language, which was inspired by setl, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system. its implementation began in december . van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until july , when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as python s benevolent dictator for life , a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker. in january , active python core developers elected a five member steering council to lead the project. python . was released on october , with many major new features, including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for unicode. python . was released on december . it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. many of its major features were backported to python . .x and . .x version series. releases of python include the to utility, which automates the translation of python code to python . python . s end of life date was initially set at then postponed to out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to python . no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. with python s end of life, only python . .x and later are supported. python . . and . . were expedited as all versions of python including . had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning. design philosophy and features python is a multi paradigm programming language. object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming including by metaprogramming and metaobjects magic methods . many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management. it also features dynamic name resolution late binding , which binds method and variable names during program execution. python s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition. it has filter,mapandreduce functions list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. the standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml. the language s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python pep , which includes aphorisms such as beautiful is better than ugly. explicit is better than implicit. simple is better than complex. complex is better than complicated. readability counts. rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, python was designed to be highly extensible with modules . this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. van rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc, which espoused the opposite approach. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. python strives for a simpler, less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. in contrast to perl s there is more than one way to do it motto, python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it design philosophy. alex martelli, a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author, writes that to describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the python culture. python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. when speed is important, a python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c, or use pypy, a just in time compiler. cython is also available, which translates a python script into c and makes direct c level api calls into the python interpreter. python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. this is reflected in its name a tribute to the british comedy group monty python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs a reference to a monty python sketch instead of the standard foo and bar. a common neologism in the python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. in contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic. users and admirers of python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as pythonistas. syntax and semantics main article python syntax and semantics python is meant to be an easily readable language. its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation. unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal. indentation main article python syntax and semantics indentation python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. an increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. thus, the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure. this feature is sometimes termed the off side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. the recommended indent size is four spaces. statements and control flow python s statements include among others the assignment statement, using a single equals sign . the if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif a contraction of else if . the for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. the while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. the try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. the raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception. the class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object oriented programming. . the def statement, which defines a function or method. the with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it , allowing resource acquisition is initialization raii like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom. the break statement, exits from a loop. the continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. the del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will because an error. a deleted variable can be reassigned. the pass statement, which serves as a nop. it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. the assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. the yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. this form is used to implement coroutines. the return statement, used to return a value from a function. the import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. the assignment statement operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. in python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. however, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations, and, according to guido van rossum, it never will. however, better support for coroutine like functionality is provided, by extending python s generators. before . , generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. from python . , it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from python . , the information can be passed through multiple stack levels. expressions some python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java, while some are not addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. there are two types of divisions in python. they are floor division or integer division and floating point division. python also uses the operator for exponentiation. from python . , the new infix operator was introduced. it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication. from python . , the syntax , called the walrus operator was introduced. it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. in python, compares by value, versus java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals method. python s is operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference . in python, comparisons may be chained, for example a b c. python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic , , used in java and c. python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression. anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y different in order of operands from the c x y operator common to many other languages . python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. lists are written as , , , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in python . tuples are written as , , , are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. the + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. thus, given the variable t initially equal to , , , executing t t + , first evaluates t + , , which yields , , , , , which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively modifying the contents of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts. python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable, a writable property, etc. , are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. the statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. python has a string format operator . this functions analogously to printf format strings in c, e.g. spam s eggs d blah , evaluates to spam blah eggs . in python and . +, this was supplemented by the format method of the str class, e.g. spam eggs .format blah , . python . added f strings blah blah eggs f spam blah eggs eggs . strings in python can be concatenated, by adding them same operator as for adding integers and floats . e.g. spam + eggs returns spameggs . even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. e.g. + returns . python has various kinds of string literals strings delimited by single or double quote marks. unlike in unix shells, perl and perl influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. both kinds of string use the backslash as an escape character. string interpolation became available in python . as formatted string literals . triple quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, perl and ruby. raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and windows style paths. compare in c . python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a key , a start stop or a start stop step . indexes are zero based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. the third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns a copy of the entire list. each element of a slice is a shallow copy. in python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as common lisp, scheme, or ruby. this leads to duplicating some functionality. for example list comprehensions vs. for loops conditional expressions vs. if blocks the eval vs. exec built in functions in python , exec is a statement the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions if c . is syntactically valid but probably unintended c code but if c . causes a syntax error in python. methods methods on objects are functions attached to the object s class the syntax instance.method argument is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for class.method instance, argument . python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self or this in some other object oriented programming languages e.g., c++, java, objective c, or ruby . apart from this, python also provides methods, often called dunder methods due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores , to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more. typing python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. type constraints are not checked at compile time rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. despite being dynamically typed, python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well defined for example, adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object oriented programming. new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example, spamclass or eggsclass , and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself , allowing metaprogramming and reflection. before version . , python had two kinds of classes old style and new style. the syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type . in versions of python from python . onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. old style classes were eliminated in python . . the long term plan is to support gradual typing and from python . , the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, cpython. an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking. arithmetic operations python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators +, , , , the floor division operator and the modulo operation where the remainder can be negative, e.g. . it also has for exponentiation, e.g. and . . , and a matrix multiplication operator . these operators work like in traditional math with the same precedence rules, the operators infix + and can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively . the division between integers produces floating point results. the behavior of division has changed significantly over time current python i.e. since . changed to always be floating point division, e.g. . . python . changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. and . the floor division operator was introduced. so , , . . and . . . adding from future import division causes a module to use python . rules for division see next . python . and earlier used c s division behavior. the operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating point division otherwise. integer division rounds towards , e.g. and . in python terms, is true division or simply division , and is floor division. before version . is classic division. rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. for instance, it means that the equation a + b b a b + is always true. it also means that the equation b a b + a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. however, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is, as expected, in the half open interval , b , where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval b, when b is negative. python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. for tie breaking, python uses round to even round . and round . both produce . versions before used round away from zero round . is . , round . is . . python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. for example, the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. c derived languages interpret this expression differently in c, the expression would first evaluate a b, resulting in or , and that result would then be compared with c. python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations. the decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers. due to python s extensive mathematics library, and the third party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation. programming examples hello world program print hello, world program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer n int input type a number, and its factorial will be printed if n raise valueerror you must enter a non negative integer factorial for i in range , n + factorial i print factorial libraries python s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. for internet facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported. it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example, the web server gateway interface wsgi implementation wsgiref follows pep , but most modules are not. they are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. however, because most of the standard library is cross platform python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. as of september , the python package index pypi , the official repository for third party python software, contains over , packages with a wide range of functionality, including automation data analytics databases documentation graphical user interfaces image processing machine learning mobile app multimedia computer networking scientific computing system administration test frameworks text processing web frameworks web scraping development environments see also comparison of integrated development environments python most python implementations including cpython include a read eval print loop repl , permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. other shells, including idle and ipython, add further abilities such as improved auto completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. as well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are web browser based ides sagemath intended for developing science and math related python programs pythonanywhere, a browser based ide and hosting environment and canopy ide, a commercial python ide emphasizing scientific computing. implementations see also list of python software python implementations reference implementation cpython is the reference implementation of python. it is written in c, meeting the c standard with several select c features with later c versions out, it is considered outdated cpython includes its own c extensions, but third party extensions are not limited to older c versions, can e.g. be implemented with c or c++ . it compiles python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and native python. it is available for many platforms, including windows starting with python . , the python installer deliberately fails to install on windows and windows xp was supported until python . and most modern unix like systems, including macos and apple m macs, since python . . , with experimental installer and unofficial support for e.g. vms. platform portability was one of its earliest priorities, during the python and python time frame, even os and solaris were supported support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. other implementations pypy is a fast, compliant interpreter of python . and . . its just in time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython but several libraries written in c cannot be used with it. stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. pypy also has a stackless version. micropython and circuitpython are python variants optimized for microcontrollers, including lego mindstorms ev . pyston is a variant of the python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of python programs. cinder is a performance oriented fork of cpython . that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method at a time jit and an experimental bytecode compiler. unsupported implementations other just in time python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported google began a project named unladen swallow in , with the aim of speeding up the python interpreter fivefold by using the llvm, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. the emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard python code. psyco does not support python . or later. pys was a python interpreter for series mobile phones released by nokia in . it implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the symbian operating system. the nokia n also supports python with gtk widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device. cross compilers to other languages there are several compilers to high level object languages, with either unrestricted python, a restricted subset of python, or a language similar to python as the source language cython compiles a superset of python . to c while the resulting code is also usable with python and also e.g. c++ . nuitka compiles python into c++. pythran compiles a subset of python to c++. pyrex latest release in and she would skin latest release in compile to c and c++ respectively. google s grumpy latest release in transpiles python to go. ironpython now abandoned by microsoft allows running python . programs on the .net common language runtime. jython compiles python . to java bytecode, allowing the use of the java libraries from a python program. myhdl is a python based hardware description language hdl , that converts myhdl code to verilog or vhdl code. numba uses llvm to compile a subset of python to machine code. brython, transcrypt and pyjs latest release in compile python to javascript. rpython can be compiled to c, and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python. performance a performance comparison of various python implementations on a non numerical combinatorial workload was presented at euroscipy . python s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game. development python s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal pep process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions. python coding style is covered in pep . outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council. enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation. the mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development. specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running mercurial, until python moved to github in january . cpython s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented backward incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. the first part of the version number is incremented. these releases happen infrequently version . was released years after . . major or feature releases, occurred about every months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python . are expected to happen once a year. they are largely compatible but introduce new features. the second part of the version number is incremented. each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release. bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. the third and final part of the version number is incremented. many alpha, beta, and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development. the major academic conference on python is pycon. there are also special python mentoring programmes, such as pyladies. python . deprecates wstr to be removed in python . meaning python extensions need to be modified by then , and also plans to add pattern matching to the language. api documentation generators tools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc available as part of standard library , sphinx, pdoc and its forks, doxygen and graphviz, among others. naming python s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python, whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language. monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines. the prefix py is used to show that something is related to python. examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame, a binding of sdl to python commonly used to create games pyqt and pygtk, which bind qt and gtk to python respectively and pypy, a python implementation originally written in python. popularity since , python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where, as of february , it is the third most popular language behind java, and c . it was selected programming language of the year for the highest rise in ratings in a year in , , , and the only language to do so four times . an empirical study found that scripting languages, such as python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as c and java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often better than java and not much worse than c or c++ . large organizations that use python include wikipedia, google, yahoo , cern, nasa, facebook, amazon, instagram, spotify and some smaller entities like ilm and ita. the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python. stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog here is a collection of resources on how to get started using python. getting started with python in this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. up now, on our list python. python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey. in , . of respondents said they want to keep working with python. conceived in the late s, it is one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers rust and typescript evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right. python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show, monty python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. while it is not primarily used for performance intensive programming, it is often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it is used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai. some regard it as an ideal language for beginners many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. history of use trending tags on stackoverflow.com although python has been around since the . release in , its usage has ballooned in recent years. indeed, as our former data scientist david robinson noted, since , it has risen above the five other major languages c++, php, java, javascript and c in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month. tiobe s index ranks python as third in popularity at . , rapidly gaining on c and java . and . respectively . today, of developers and technologists around the world are using python. until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person dutch computer scientist guido van rossum, who stepped down as python s benevolent dictator for life in but has remained an active contributor to this day. who is using it python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that do not use it in some form. while it is not the language of choice for consumer applications like d games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities. it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example, in the vfx field, nearly all of the major software packages maya, ds max, houdini, cinema d, blender, and nuke have embedded python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. it is used more or less everywhere on earth and, well, even on mars. in fact, if you are reading this on a mac, you already have python installed on your computer just go to terminal, type python , and away you go who is it for students the use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners. see the example below. additionally, python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you will spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c++. it comes bundled with a free ide integrated development environment , idle, so you can get started quickly. in case you are wondering, yes, idle is a reference to monty python s eric idle if you use python you are going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy. developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed while python typically runs slower than other common languages like c++ or java, it is often much quicker to write indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c++ version. this is one of the reasons it is often used as a support language software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. for the same reason, it is also used for prototyping code can be hacked together quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. developers working with text or numbers python s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. and it is a great tool for exploring data. the fact that it does not need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step by step, examining it at each stage. python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of packages , many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. these include the venerable numpy mathematical functions and data analysis , scipy for science , matplotlib data visualization and pandas data analysis , and more recently tensorflow and keras machine learning ai , as well as tens of thousands of others. web developers another key area of python use is backend development. it has built in support for common protocols like html, xml, and json, and frameworks like django, flask, and bottle are used widely for example, reddit s backend is python. python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. why you should not learn it there is a lot to like about python, but it is not always the perfect tool for the job. perhaps most importantly, python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like c++. while that means there is no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. so you are probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster fps first person shooter in python, but it is perfect for situations like data manipulation where you are likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. additionally, python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it is your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. for example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of english words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c++. however, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced

              "'python programming language from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia python is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large scale projects. python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured particularly, procedural , object oriented and functional programming. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. guido van rossum began working on python in the late s, as a successor to the abc programming language, and first released it in as python . . . python . was released in and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. python . was released in and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. python was discontinued with version . . in . python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. history python was conceived in the late s by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde informatica cwi in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language, which was inspired by setl, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system. its implementation began in december . van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until july , when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as python s benevolent dictator for life , a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker. in january , active python core developers elected a five member steering council to lead the project. python . was released on october , with many major new features, including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for unicode. python . was released on december . it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. many of its major features were backported to python . .x and . .x version series. releases of python include the to utility, which automates the translation of python code to python . python . s end of life date was initially set at then postponed to out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to python . no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. with python s end of life, only python . .x and later are supported. python . . and . . were expedited as all versions of python including . had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning. design philosophy and features python is a multi paradigm programming language. object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming including by metaprogramming and metaobjects magic methods . many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management. it also features dynamic name resolution late binding , which binds method and variable names during program execution. python s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition. it has filter,mapandreduce functions list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. the standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml. the language s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python pep , which includes aphorisms such as beautiful is better than ugly. explicit is better than implicit. simple is better than complex. complex is better than complicated. readability counts. rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, python was designed to be highly extensible with modules . this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. van rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc, which espoused the opposite approach. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. python strives for a simpler, less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. in contrast to perl s there is more than one way to do it motto, python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it design philosophy. alex martelli, a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author, writes that to describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the python culture. python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. when speed is important, a python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c, or use pypy, a just in time compiler. cython is also available, which translates a python script into c and makes direct c level api calls into the python interpreter. python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. this is reflected in its name a tribute to the british comedy group monty python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs a reference to a monty python sketch instead of the standard foo and bar. a common neologism in the python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. in contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic. users and admirers of python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as pythonistas. syntax and semantics main article python syntax and semantics python is meant to be an easily readable language. its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation. unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal. indentation main article python syntax and semantics indentation python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. an increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. thus, the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure. this feature is sometimes termed the off side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. the recommended indent size is four spaces. statements and control flow python s statements include among others the assignment statement, using a single equals sign . the if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif a contraction of else if . the for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. the while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. the try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. the raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception. the class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object oriented programming. . the def statement, which defines a function or method. the with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it , allowing resource acquisition is initialization raii like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom. the break statement, exits from a loop. the continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. the del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will because an error. a deleted variable can be reassigned. the pass statement, which serves as a nop. it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. the assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. the yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. this form is used to implement coroutines. the return statement, used to return a value from a function. the import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. the assignment statement operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. in python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. however, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations, and, according to guido van rossum, it never will. however, better support for coroutine like functionality is provided, by extending python s generators. before . , generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. from python . , it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from python . , the information can be passed through multiple stack levels. expressions some python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java, while some are not addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. there are two types of divisions in python. they are floor division or integer division and floating point division. python also uses the operator for exponentiation. from python . , the new infix operator was introduced. it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication. from python . , the syntax , called the walrus operator was introduced. it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. in python, compares by value, versus java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals method. python s is operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference . in python, comparisons may be chained, for example a b c. python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic , , used in java and c. python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression. anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y different in order of operands from the c x y operator common to many other languages . python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. lists are written as , , , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in python . tuples are written as , , , are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. the + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. thus, given the variable t initially equal to , , , executing t t + , first evaluates t + , , which yields , , , , , which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively modifying the contents of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts. python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable, a writable property, etc. , are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. the statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. python has a string format operator . this functions analogously to printf format strings in c, e.g. spam s eggs d blah , evaluates to spam blah eggs . in python and . +, this was supplemented by the format method of the str class, e.g. spam eggs .format blah , . python . added f strings blah blah eggs f spam blah eggs eggs . strings in python can be concatenated, by adding them same operator as for adding integers and floats . e.g. spam + eggs returns spameggs . even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. e.g. + returns . python has various kinds of string literals strings delimited by single or double quote marks. unlike in unix shells, perl and perl influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. both kinds of string use the backslash as an escape character. string interpolation became available in python . as formatted string literals . triple quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, perl and ruby. raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and windows style paths. compare in c . python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a key , a start stop or a start stop step . indexes are zero based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. the third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns a copy of the entire list. each element of a slice is a shallow copy. in python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as common lisp, scheme, or ruby. this leads to duplicating some functionality. for example list comprehensions vs. for loops conditional expressions vs. if blocks the eval vs. exec built in functions in python , exec is a statement the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions if c . is syntactically valid but probably unintended c code but if c . causes a syntax error in python. methods methods on objects are functions attached to the object s class the syntax instance.method argument is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for class.method instance, argument . python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self or this in some other object oriented programming languages e.g., c++, java, objective c, or ruby . apart from this, python also provides methods, often called dunder methods due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores , to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more. typing python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. type constraints are not checked at compile time rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. despite being dynamically typed, python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well defined for example, adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object oriented programming. new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example, spamclass or eggsclass , and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself , allowing metaprogramming and reflection. before version . , python had two kinds of classes old style and new style. the syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type . in versions of python from python . onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. old style classes were eliminated in python . . the long term plan is to support gradual typing and from python . , the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, cpython. an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking. arithmetic operations python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators +, , , , the floor division operator and the modulo operation where the remainder can be negative, e.g. . it also has for exponentiation, e.g. and . . , and a matrix multiplication operator . these operators work like in traditional math with the same precedence rules, the operators infix + and can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively . the division between integers produces floating point results. the behavior of division has changed significantly over time current python i.e. since . changed to always be floating point division, e.g. . . python . changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. and . the floor division operator was introduced. so , , . . and . . . adding from future import division causes a module to use python . rules for division see next . python . and earlier used c s division behavior. the operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating point division otherwise. integer division rounds towards , e.g. and . in python terms, is true division or simply division , and is floor division. before version . is classic division. rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. for instance, it means that the equation a + b b a b + is always true. it also means that the equation b a b + a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. however, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is, as expected, in the half open interval , b , where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval b, when b is negative. python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. for tie breaking, python uses round to even round . and round . both produce . versions before used round away from zero round . is . , round . is . . python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. for example, the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. c derived languages interpret this expression differently in c, the expression would first evaluate a b, resulting in or , and that result would then be compared with c. python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations. the decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers. due to python s extensive mathematics library, and the third party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation. programming examples hello world program print hello, world program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer n int input type a number, and its factorial will be printed if n raise valueerror you must enter a non negative integer factorial for i in range , n + factorial i print factorial libraries python s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. for internet facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported. it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example, the web server gateway interface wsgi implementation wsgiref follows pep , but most modules are not. they are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. however, because most of the standard library is cross platform python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. as of september , the python package index pypi , the official repository for third party python software, contains over , packages with a wide range of functionality, including automation data analytics databases documentation graphical user interfaces image processing machine learning mobile app multimedia computer networking scientific computing system administration test frameworks text processing web frameworks web scraping development environments see also comparison of integrated development environments python most python implementations including cpython include a read eval print loop repl , permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. other shells, including idle and ipython, add further abilities such as improved auto completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. as well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are web browser based ides sagemath intended for developing science and math related python programs pythonanywhere, a browser based ide and hosting environment and canopy ide, a commercial python ide emphasizing scientific computing. implementations see also list of python software python implementations reference implementation cpython is the reference implementation of python. it is written in c, meeting the c standard with several select c features with later c versions out, it is considered outdated cpython includes its own c extensions, but third party extensions are not limited to older c versions, can e.g. be implemented with c or c++ . it compiles python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and native python. it is available for many platforms, including windows starting with python . , the python installer deliberately fails to install on windows and windows xp was supported until python . and most modern unix like systems, including macos and apple m macs, since python . . , with experimental installer and unofficial support for e.g. vms. platform portability was one of its earliest priorities, during the python and python time frame, even os and solaris were supported support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. other implementations pypy is a fast, compliant interpreter of python . and . . its just in time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython but several libraries written in c cannot be used with it. stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. pypy also has a stackless version. micropython and circuitpython are python variants optimized for microcontrollers, including lego mindstorms ev . pyston is a variant of the python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of python programs. cinder is a performance oriented fork of cpython . that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method at a time jit and an experimental bytecode compiler. unsupported implementations other just in time python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported google began a project named unladen swallow in , with the aim of speeding up the python interpreter fivefold by using the llvm, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. the emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard python code. psyco does not support python . or later. pys was a python interpreter for series mobile phones released by nokia in . it implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the symbian operating system. the nokia n also supports python with gtk widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device. cross compilers to other languages there are several compilers to high level object languages, with either unrestricted python, a restricted subset of python, or a language similar to python as the source language cython compiles a superset of python . to c while the resulting code is also usable with python and also e.g. c++ . nuitka compiles python into c++. pythran compiles a subset of python to c++. pyrex latest release in and she would skin latest release in compile to c and c++ respectively. google s grumpy latest release in transpiles python to go. ironpython now abandoned by microsoft allows running python . programs on the .net common language runtime. jython compiles python . to java bytecode, allowing the use of the java libraries from a python program. myhdl is a python based hardware description language hdl , that converts myhdl code to verilog or vhdl code. numba uses llvm to compile a subset of python to machine code. brython, transcrypt and pyjs latest release in compile python to javascript. rpython can be compiled to c, and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python. performance a performance comparison of various python implementations on a non numerical combinatorial workload was presented at euroscipy . python s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game. development python s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal pep process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions. python coding style is covered in pep . outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council. enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation. the mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development. specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running mercurial, until python moved to github in january . cpython s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented backward incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. the first part of the version number is incremented. these releases happen infrequently version . was released years after . . major or feature releases, occurred about every months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python . are expected to happen once a year. they are largely compatible but introduce new features. the second part of the version number is incremented. each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release. bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. the third and final part of the version number is incremented. many alpha, beta, and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development. the major academic conference on python is pycon. there are also special python mentoring programmes, such as pyladies. python . deprecates wstr to be removed in python . meaning python extensions need to be modified by then , and also plans to add pattern matching to the language. api documentation generators tools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc available as part of standard library , sphinx, pdoc and its forks, doxygen and graphviz, among others. naming python s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python, whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language. monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines. the prefix py is used to show that something is related to python. examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame, a binding of sdl to python commonly used to create games pyqt and pygtk, which bind qt and gtk to python respectively and pypy, a python implementation originally written in python. popularity since , python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where, as of february , it is the third most popular language behind java, and c . it was selected programming language of the year for the highest rise in ratings in a year in , , , and the only language to do so four times . an empirical study found that scripting languages, such as python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as c and java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often better than java and not much worse than c or c++ . large organizations that use python include wikipedia, google, yahoo , cern, nasa, facebook, amazon, instagram, spotify and some smaller entities like ilm and ita. the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python. stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog here is a collection of resources on how to get started using python. getting started with python in this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. up now, on our list python. python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey. in , . of respondents said they want to keep working with python. conceived in the late s, it is one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers rust and typescript evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right. python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show, monty python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. while it is not primarily used for performance intensive programming, it is often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it is used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai. some regard it as an ideal language for beginners many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. history of use trending tags on stackoverflow.com although python has been around since the . release in , its usage has ballooned in recent years. indeed, as our former data scientist david robinson noted, since , it has risen above the five other major languages c++, php, java, javascript and c in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month. tiobe s index ranks python as third in popularity at . , rapidly gaining on c and java . and . respectively . today, of developers and technologists around the world are using python. until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person dutch computer scientist guido van rossum, who stepped down as python s benevolent dictator for life in but has remained an active contributor to this day. who is using it python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that do not use it in some form. while it is not the language of choice for consumer applications like d games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities. it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example, in the vfx field, nearly all of the major software packages maya, ds max, houdini, cinema d, blender, and nuke have embedded python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. it is used more or less everywhere on earth and, well, even on mars. in fact, if you are reading this on a mac, you already have python installed on your computer just go to terminal, type python , and away you go who is it for students the use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners. see the example below. additionally, python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you will spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c++. it comes bundled with a free ide integrated development environment , idle, so you can get started quickly. in case you are wondering, yes, idle is a reference to monty python s eric idle if you use python you are going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy. developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed while python typically runs slower than other common languages like c++ or java, it is often much quicker to write indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c++ version. this is one of the reasons it is often used as a support language software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. for the same reason, it is also used for prototyping code can be hacked together quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. developers working with text or numbers python s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. and it is a great tool for exploring data. the fact that it does not need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step by step, examining it at each stage. python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of packages , many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. these include the venerable numpy mathematical functions and data analysis , scipy for science , matplotlib data visualization and pandas data analysis , and more recently tensorflow and keras machine learning ai , as well as tens of thousands of others. web developers another key area of python use is backend development. it has built in support for common protocols like html, xml, and json, and frameworks like django, flask, and bottle are used widely for example, reddit s backend is python. python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. why you should not learn it there is a lot to like about python, but it is not always the perfect tool for the job. perhaps most importantly, python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like c++. while that means there is no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. so you are probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster fps first person shooter in python, but it is perfect for situations like data manipulation where you are likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. additionally, python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it is your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. for example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of english words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c++. however, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity. key concepts the core philosophies are summarized in pythonic fashion in the zen of python. these include readability counts simple is better than complex there should be one and

              "'Python (programming language) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30] Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31] Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33] Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[34][35][36][37] History Python was conceived in the late 1980s[38] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[39] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its implementation began in December 1989.[40] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python\\'s \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker.[41] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member \"Steering Council\" to lead the project.[42][43] Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.[44] Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[45] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[46] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[47] Python 2.7\\'s end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[48][49] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[50][51] With Python 2\\'s end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[52] and later are supported. Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[53] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[54]) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution[55] and web cache poisoning.[56] Design philosophy and features Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[57] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[58] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[59][60] and logic programming.[61] Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[62] It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution. Python\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[63] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[64] The language\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[65] Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts. Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[38] It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[66] Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl\\'s \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[65] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that \"To describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[67] Python\\'s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[68] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter. Python\\'s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[69]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[70][71] A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[72][73] Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.[74][75] Syntax and semantics Main article: Python syntax and semantics Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[76] Indentation Main article: Python syntax and semantics § Indentation Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[77] Thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents the program\\'s semantic structure.[78] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[79] Statements and control flow Python\\'s statements include (among others): The assignment statement, using a single equals sign =. The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if). The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception. The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming. يبلميبةملنةيمبنلةيمنبةلمنيب يبل ينمبةل يمبنةل 0يب . يبلمويلك The def statement, which defines a function or method. The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[80] The break statement, exits from a loop. The continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. The del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will because an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned. The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines. The return statement, used to return a value from a function. The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. The assignment statement (=) operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. However, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. This is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically-typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[81][82] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided, by extending Python\\'s generators.[83] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[84] Expressions Some Python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as C and Java, while some are not: Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[85] Python also uses the ** operator for exponentiation. From Python 3.5, the new infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[86][87] From Python 3.8, the syntax :=, called the \\'walrus operator\\' was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[88] In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value[89] and objects by reference.[90] (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) Python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c. Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C. Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression.[63] Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y[91] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages). Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[92] Python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[93] Python has a \"string format\" operator %. This functions analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": blah = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}\\'.[94] Strings in Python can be concatenated, by \"adding\" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). E.g. \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. E.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\". Python has various kinds of string literals: Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[94] Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby. Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare in C#. Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy. In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example: List comprehensions vs. for-loops Conditional expressions vs. if blocks The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { . } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: . causes a syntax error in Python. Methods Methods on objects are functions attached to the object\\'s class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).[95] Apart from this, Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more.[96] Typing Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically-typed, Python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection. Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[97] The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0. The long-term plan is to support gradual typing[98] and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.[99] Arithmetic operations Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator .[103] These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively). The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[104] Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5. Python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. The floor division // operator was introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next). Python 2.1 and earlier used C\\'s division behavior. The / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -2. In Python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[104] Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[105] Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[106] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[107] Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[108] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[109] Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[110] The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[111] Due to Python\\'s extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[112][113] Programming examples Hello world program: print(\\'Hello, world!\\') Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer: n = int(input(\\'Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: \\')) if n < 0: raise ValueError(\\'You must enter a non-negative integer\\') factorial = 1 for i in range(2, n + 1): factorial *= i print(factorial) Libraries Python\\'s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,[114] provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[115] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333[116]), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. As of September 2021, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 329,000[117] packages with a wide range of functionality, including: Automation Data analytics Databases Documentation Graphical user interfaces Image processing Machine learning Mobile App Multimedia Computer networking Scientific computing System administration Test frameworks Text processing Web frameworks Web scraping Development environments See also: Comparison of integrated development environments § Python Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs; SageMath (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.[118] نيوبملمينبل Implementations See also: List of Python software § Python implementations Reference implementation CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard with several select C99 features (with later C versions out, it is considered outdated;[119][120] CPython includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions, can e.g. be implemented with C11 or C++[121]).[122] It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode[123] which is then executed by its virtual machine.[124] CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including Windows (starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8;[125][126] Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS.[127] Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities,[128] during the Python 1 and Python 2 time-frame, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported;[129] support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. Other implementations PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.6.[130] Its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython but several libraries written in C cannot be used with it.[131] Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.[132] MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including Lego Mindstorms EV3.[133] Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs.[134] Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT and an experimental bytecode compiler.[135] Unsupported implementations Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported: Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores,[136] while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. Psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later. PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones released by Nokia in 2005. It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.[137] Cross-compilers to other languages There are several compilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language: Cython compiles (a superset of) Python 2.7 to C (while the resulting code is also usable with Python 3 and also e.g. C++). Nuitka compiles Python into C++.[138] Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++.[139][140][141] Pyrex (latest release in 2010) and She Would Skin (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively. Google\\'s Grumpy (latest release in 2017) transpiles Python 2 to Go.[142][143][144] IronPython (now abandoned by Microsoft) allows running Python 2.7 programs on the .NET Common Language Runtime.[145] Jython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program.[146] MyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL), that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code. Numba uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python to machine code. Brython,[147] Transcrypt[148][149] and Pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile Python to JavaScript. RPython can be compiled to C, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python. Performance A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy \\'13.[150] Python\\'s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.[151] Development Python\\'s development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions.[152] Python coding style is covered in PEP 8.[153] Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.[152] Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. Specific issues are discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org.[154] Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.[155] CPython\\'s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented: Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. Major or \"feature\" releases, occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with Python 3.9 are expected to happen once a year.[156][157] They are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.[158] Bugfix releases,[159] which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.[159] Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.[160] The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as Pyladies. Python 3.10 deprecates wstr (to be removed in Python 3.12; meaning Python extensions[161] need to be modified by then),[162] and also plans to add pattern matching to the language.[163] API documentation generators Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc (available as part of standard library), Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others.[164] Naming Python\\'s name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;[165] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar.[165][166] The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.[167][168] The prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python. Popularity Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, as of February 2021, it is the third most popular language (behind Java, and C).[169] It was selected Programming Language of the Year (for \"the highest rise in ratings in a year\") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times[170]).[171] An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often \"better than Java and not much worse than C or C++\".[172] Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google,[173] Yahoo!,[174] CERN,[175] NASA,[176] Facebook,[177] Amazon, Instagram,[178] Spotify[179] and some smaller entities like ILM[180] and ITA.[181] The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python.[182] _________________________________________ stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog Here is a collection of resources on how to get started using Python. Getting started with… Python In this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the Stack Overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. Up now, #3 on our list: Python. Python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our Developer Survey. In 2020, 66.7% of respondents said they want to keep working with Python. Conceived in the late 80s, it is one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers Rust (2010) and TypeScript (2012)—evidence that original designer Guido van Rossum got a lot right. Python’s quirky name—in honor of the cult comedy show, Monty Python—belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. While it is not primarily used for performance-intensive programming, it is often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. This makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it is used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to VFX and AI. Some regard it as an ideal language for beginners: many terms are expressed using English words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in Python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. History of use Trending tags on Stackoverflow.com Although Python has been around since the 1.0 release in 1991, its usage has ballooned in recent years. Indeed, as our former data scientist David Robinson noted, since 2012, it has risen above the five other major languages (C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript and C#) in usage as estimated by the number of Stack Overflow question views per month. TIOBE’s 2021 index ranks Python as third in popularity at 10.86%, rapidly gaining on C and Java (16.34% and 11.29% respectively). Today, 44 % of developers and technologists around the world are using Python. Until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person—Dutch computer scientist Guido van Rossum, who stepped down as Python’s “Benevolent Dictator For Life” in 2018 but has remained an active contributor to this day. Who is using it? Python is more or less ubiquitous—it would be faster to list industries that do not use it in some form. While it is not the language of choice for consumer applications like 3D games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use Python for tools and utilities. It is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes—for example, in the VFX field, nearly all of the major software packages (Maya, 3Ds Max, Houdini, Cinema 4D, Blender, and Nuke) have embedded Python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. It is used more or less everywhere on Earth and, well, even on Mars. In fact, if you are reading this on a Mac, you already have Python installed on your computer—just go to Terminal, type ‘python’, and away you go… Who is it for? Students The use of short English keywords instead of symbols makes Python particularly friendly for beginners. See the example below. Additionally, Python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you will spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like C++. It comes bundled with a free IDE (integrated development environment), IDLE, so you can get started quickly. In case you are wondering, yes, IDLE is a reference to Monty Python’s Eric Idle—if you use Python you are going to be bombarded with references to vintage British comedy. Developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed While Python typically runs slower than other common languages like C++ or Java, it is often much quicker to write—indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in Python is three to five times shorter than its Java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the C++ version. This is one of the reasons it is often used as a “support language”—software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. For the same reason, it is also used for prototyping—code can be “hacked together” quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. Developers working with text or numbers Python’s powerful String and List manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. And it is a great tool for exploring data. The fact that it does not need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running Python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step-by-step, examining it at each stage. Python’s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of ‘packages’, many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. These include the venerable NumPy (mathematical functions and data analysis), SciPy (for science), Matplotlib (data visualization) and Pandas (data analysis), and more recently TensorFlow and Keras (Machine Learning/AI), as well as tens of thousands of others. Web developers Another key area of Python use is backend development. It has built-in support for common protocols like HTML, XML, and JSON, and frameworks like Django, Flask, and Bottle are used widely—for example, Reddit’s backend is Python. Python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. Why you should not learn it There is a lot to like about Python, but it is not always the perfect tool for the job. Perhaps most importantly, Python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like C++. While that means there is no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. So you are probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster 60FPS first-person shooter in Python, but it is perfect for situations like data manipulation where you are likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. Additionally, Python’s somewhat unusual syntax means that—if it is your first language—not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. For example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of English words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in Python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in Java or C++. However, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity. Key concepts The core philosophies are summarized—in Pythonic fashion—in “The Zen Of Python.” These include: “Readability counts Simple is better than complex There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it” In case you were wondering, The Zen Of Python is available in catchy musical form here.

              "'Python programming language From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Python is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large scale projects. Python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured particularly, procedural , object oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in as Python . . . Python . was released in and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python . was released in and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. Python was discontinued with version . . in . Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. History Python was conceived in the late s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde Informatica CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December . Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until July , when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Python s Benevolent Dictator For Life , a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker. In January , active Python core developers elected a five member Steering Council to lead the project. Python . was released on October , with many major new features, including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode. Python . was released on December . It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python . .x and . .x version series. Releases of Python include the to utility, which automates the translation of Python code to Python . Python . s end of life date was initially set at then postponed to out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to Python . No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python s end of life, only Python . .x and later are supported. Python . . and . . were expedited as all versions of Python including . had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning. Design philosophy and features Python is a multi paradigm programming language. Object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming including by metaprogramming and metaobjects magic methods . Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution late binding , which binds method and variable names during program execution. Python s design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML. The language s core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python PEP , which includes aphorisms such as Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts. Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible with modules . This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach. It is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. Python strives for a simpler, less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl s there is more than one way to do it motto, Python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it design philosophy. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that To describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the Python culture. Python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just in time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C level API calls into the Python interpreter. Python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs a reference to a Monty Python sketch instead of the standard foo and bar. A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic. Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas. Syntax and semantics Main article Python syntax and semantics Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal. Indentation Main article Python syntax and semantics Indentation Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces. Statements and control flow Python s statements include among others The assignment statement, using a single equals sign . The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif a contraction of else if . The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception. The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object oriented programming. . The def statement, which defines a function or method. The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it , allowing resource acquisition is initialization RAII like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom. The break statement, exits from a loop. The continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. The del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will because an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned. The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines. The return statement, used to return a value from a function. The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. The assignment statement operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. However, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. This is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. Python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine like functionality is provided, by extending Python s generators. Before . , generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python . , it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python . , the information can be passed through multiple stack levels. Expressions Some Python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as C and Java, while some are not Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division or integer division and floating point division. Python also uses the operator for exponentiation. From Python . , the new infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication. From Python . , the syntax , called the walrus operator was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. In Python, compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals method. Python s is operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference . In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a b c. Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic , , used in Java and C. Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression. Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y different in order of operands from the c x y operator common to many other languages . Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as , , , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in Python . Tuples are written as , , , are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to , , , executing t t + , first evaluates t + , , which yields , , , , , which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively modifying the contents of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts. Python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable, a writable property, etc. , are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. Python has a string format operator . This functions analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g. spam s eggs d blah , evaluates to spam blah eggs . In Python and . +, this was supplemented by the format method of the str class, e.g. spam eggs .format blah , . Python . added f strings blah blah eggs f spam blah eggs eggs . Strings in Python can be concatenated, by adding them same operator as for adding integers and floats . E.g. spam + eggs returns spameggs . Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. E.g. + returns . Python has various kinds of string literals Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python . as formatted string literals . Triple quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby. Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows style paths. Compare in C . Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a key , a start stop or a start stop step . Indexes are zero based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy. In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example List comprehensions vs. for loops Conditional expressions vs. if blocks The eval vs. exec built in functions in Python , exec is a statement the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions if c . is syntactically valid but probably unintended C code but if c . causes a syntax error in Python. Methods Methods on objects are functions attached to the object s class the syntax instance.method argument is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method instance, argument . Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self or this in some other object oriented programming languages e.g., C++, Java, Objective C, or Ruby . Apart from this, Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores , to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more. Typing Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well defined for example, adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example, SpamClass or EggsClass , and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself , allowing metaprogramming and reflection. Before version . , Python had two kinds of classes old style and new style. The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type . In versions of Python from Python . onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old style classes were eliminated in Python . . The long term plan is to support gradual typing and from Python . , the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking. Arithmetic operations Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators +, , , , the floor division operator and the modulo operation where the remainder can be negative, e.g. . It also has for exponentiation, e.g. and . . , and a matrix multiplication operator . These operators work like in traditional math with the same precedence rules, the operators infix + and can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively . The division between integers produces floating point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time Current Python i.e. since . changed to always be floating point division, e.g. . . Python . changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. and . The floor division operator was introduced. So , , . . and . . . Adding from future import division causes a module to use Python . rules for division see next . Python . and earlier used C s division behavior. The operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards , e.g. and . In Python terms, is true division or simply division , and is floor division. before version . is classic division. Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation a + b b a b + is always true. It also means that the equation b a b + a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is, as expected, in the half open interval , b , where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval b, when b is negative. Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie breaking, Python uses round to even round . and round . both produce . Versions before used round away from zero round . is . , round . is . . Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C derived languages interpret this expression differently in C, the expression would first evaluate a b, resulting in or , and that result would then be compared with c. Python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers. Due to Python s extensive mathematics library, and the third party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation. Programming examples Hello world program print Hello, world Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer n int input Type a number, and its factorial will be printed if n raise ValueError You must enter a non negative integer factorial for i in range , n + factorial i print factorial Libraries Python s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface WSGI implementation wsgiref follows PEP , but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. As of September , the Python Package Index PyPI , the official repository for third party Python software, contains over , packages with a wide range of functionality, including Automation Data analytics Databases Documentation Graphical user interfaces Image processing Machine learning Mobile App Multimedia Computer networking Scientific computing System administration Test frameworks Text processing Web frameworks Web scraping Development environments See also Comparison of integrated development environments Python Most Python implementations including CPython include a read eval print loop REPL , permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser based IDEs SageMath intended for developing science and math related Python programs PythonAnywhere, a browser based IDE and hosting environment and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing. Implementations See also List of Python software Python implementations Reference implementation CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C standard with several select C features with later C versions out, it is considered outdated CPython includes its own C extensions, but third party extensions are not limited to older C versions, can e.g. be implemented with C or C++ . It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including Windows starting with Python . , the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows and Windows XP was supported until Python . and most modern Unix like systems, including macOS and Apple M Macs, since Python . . , with experimental installer and unofficial support for e.g. VMS. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities, during the Python and Python time frame, even OS and Solaris were supported support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. Other implementations PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python . and . . Its just in time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython but several libraries written in C cannot be used with it. Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version. MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python variants optimized for microcontrollers, including Lego Mindstorms EV . Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs. Cinder is a performance oriented fork of CPython . that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method at a time JIT and an experimental bytecode compiler. Unsupported implementations Other just in time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in , with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. Psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python . or later. PyS was a Python interpreter for Series mobile phones released by Nokia in . It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device. Cross compilers to other languages There are several compilers to high level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language Cython compiles a superset of Python . to C while the resulting code is also usable with Python and also e.g. C++ . Nuitka compiles Python into C++. Pythran compiles a subset of Python to C++. Pyrex latest release in and She Would Skin latest release in compile to C and C++ respectively. Google s Grumpy latest release in transpiles Python to Go. IronPython now abandoned by Microsoft allows running Python . programs on the .NET Common Language Runtime. Jython compiles Python . to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program. MyHDL is a Python based hardware description language HDL , that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code. Numba uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python to machine code. Brython, Transcrypt and Pyjs latest release in compile Python to JavaScript. RPython can be compiled to C, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python. Performance A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non numerical combinatorial workload was presented at EuroSciPy . Python s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game. Development Python s development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal PEP process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP . Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council. Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development. Specific issues are discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. Development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January . CPython s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented Backward incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently version . was released years after . . Major or feature releases, occurred about every months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with Python . are expected to happen once a year. They are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release. Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented. Many alpha, beta, and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development. The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as Pyladies. Python . deprecates wstr to be removed in Python . meaning Python extensions need to be modified by then , and also plans to add pattern matching to the language. API documentation generators Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc available as part of standard library , Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others. Naming Python s name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines. The prefix Py is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python commonly used to create games PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python. Popularity Since , Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, as of February , it is the third most popular language behind Java, and C . It was selected Programming Language of the Year for the highest rise in ratings in a year in , , , and the only language to do so four times . An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often better than Java and not much worse than C or C++ . Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo , CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python. stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog Here is a collection of resources on how to get started using Python. Getting started with Python In this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the Stack Overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. Up now, on our list Python. Python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our Developer Survey. In , . of respondents said they want to keep working with Python. Conceived in the late s, it is one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers Rust and TypeScript evidence that original designer Guido van Rossum got a lot right. Python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show, Monty Python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. While it is not primarily used for performance intensive programming, it is often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. This makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it is used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to VFX and AI. Some regard it as an ideal language for beginners many terms are expressed using English words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in Python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. History of use Trending tags on Stackoverflow.com Although Python has been around since the . release in , its usage has ballooned in recent years. Indeed, as our former data scientist David Robinson noted, since , it has risen above the five other major languages C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript and C in usage as estimated by the number of Stack Overflow question views per month. TIOBE s index ranks Python as third in popularity at . , rapidly gaining on C and Java . and . respectively . Today, of developers and technologists around the world are using Python. Until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person Dutch computer scientist Guido van Rossum, who stepped down as Python s Benevolent Dictator For Life in but has remained an active contributor to this day. Who is using it Python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that do not use it in some form. While it is not the language of choice for consumer applications like D games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use Python for tools and utilities. It is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example, in the VFX field, nearly all of the major software packages Maya, Ds Max, Houdini, Cinema D, Blender, and Nuke have embedded Python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. It is used more or less everywhere on Earth and, well, even on Mars. In fact, if you are reading this on a Mac, you already have Python installed on your computer just go to Terminal, type python , and away you go Who is it for Students The use of short English keywords instead of symbols makes Python particularly friendly for beginners. See the example below. Additionally, Python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you will spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like C++. It comes bundled with a free IDE integrated development environment , IDLE, so you can get started quickly. In case you are wondering, yes, IDLE is a reference to Monty Python s Eric Idle if you use Python you are going to be bombarded with references to vintage British comedy. Developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed While Python typically runs slower than other common languages like C++ or Java, it is often much quicker to write indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in Python is three to five times shorter than its Java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the C++ version. This is one of the reasons it is often used as a support language software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. For the same reason, it is also used for prototyping code can be hacked together quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. Developers working with text or numbers Python s powerful String and List manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. And it is a great tool for exploring data. The fact that it does not need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running Python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step by step, examining it at each stage. Python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of packages , many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. These include the venerable NumPy mathematical functions and data analysis , SciPy for science , Matplotlib data visualization and Pandas data analysis , and more recently TensorFlow and Keras Machine Learning AI , as well as tens of thousands of others. Web developers Another key area of Python use is backend development. It has built in support for common protocols like HTML, XML, and JSON, and frameworks like Django, Flask, and Bottle are used widely for example, Reddit s backend is Python. Python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. Why you should not learn it There is a lot to like about Python, but it is not always the perfect tool for the job. Perhaps most importantly, Python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like C++. While that means there is no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. So you are probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster FPS first person shooter in Python, but it is perfect for situations like data manipulation where you are likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. Additionally, Python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it is your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. For example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of English words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in Python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in Java or C++. However, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity. Key concepts The core philosophies are summarized in Pythonic fashion in The Zen Of Python. These include Readability counts Simple is better than complex There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it In case you were wondering, The Zen Of Python is available in catchy musical form here.

              "'Python programming language From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Python is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large scale projects. Python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured particularly, procedural , object oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in as Python . . . Python . was released in and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python . was released in and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. Python was discontinued with version . . in . Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. History Python was conceived in the late s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde Informatica CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December . Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until July , when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Python s Benevolent Dictator For Life , a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker. In January , active Python core developers elected a five member Steering Council to lead the project. Python . was released on October , with many major new features, including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode. Python . was released on December . It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python . .x and . .x version series. Releases of Python include the to utility, which automates the translation of Python code to Python . Python . s end of life date was initially set at then postponed to out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to Python . No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python s end of life, only Python . .x and later are supported. Python . . and . . were expedited as all versions of Python including . had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning. Design philosophy and features Python is a multi paradigm programming language. Object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming including by metaprogramming and metaobjects magic methods . Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution late binding , which binds method and variable names during program execution. Python s design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML. The language s core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python PEP , which includes aphorisms such as Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts. Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible with modules . This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach. It is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. Python strives for a simpler, less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl s there is more than one way to do it motto, Python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it design philosophy. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that To describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the Python culture. Python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just in time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C level API calls into the Python interpreter. Python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs a reference to a Monty Python sketch instead of the standard foo and bar. A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic. Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas. Syntax and semantics Main article Python syntax and semantics Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal. Indentation Main article Python syntax and semantics Indentation Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces. Statements and control flow Python s statements include among others The assignment statement, using a single equals sign . The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif a contraction of else if . The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception. The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object oriented programming. . The def statement, which defines a function or method. The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it , allowing resource acquisition is initialization RAII like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom. The break statement, exits from a loop. The continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. The del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will because an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned. The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines. The return statement, used to return a value from a function. The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. The assignment statement operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. However, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. This is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. Python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine like functionality is provided, by extending Python s generators. Before . , generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python . , it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python . , the information can be passed through multiple stack levels. Expressions Some Python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as C and Java, while some are not Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division or integer division and floating point division. Python also uses the operator for exponentiation. From Python . , the new infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication. From Python . , the syntax , called the walrus operator was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. In Python, compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals method. Python s is operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference . In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a b c. Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic , , used in Java and C. Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression. Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y different in order of operands from the c x y operator common to many other languages . Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as , , , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in Python . Tuples are written as , , , are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to , , , executing t t + , first evaluates t + , , which yields , , , , , which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively modifying the contents of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts. Python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable, a writable property, etc. , are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. Python has a string format operator . This functions analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g. spam s eggs d blah , evaluates to spam blah eggs . In Python and . +, this was supplemented by the format method of the str class, e.g. spam eggs .format blah , . Python . added f strings blah blah eggs f spam blah eggs eggs . Strings in Python can be concatenated, by adding them same operator as for adding integers and floats . E.g. spam + eggs returns spameggs . Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. E.g. + returns . Python has various kinds of string literals Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python . as formatted string literals . Triple quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby. Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows style paths. Compare in C . Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a key , a start stop or a start stop step . Indexes are zero based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy. In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example List comprehensions vs. for loops Conditional expressions vs. if blocks The eval vs. exec built in functions in Python , exec is a statement the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions if c . is syntactically valid but probably unintended C code but if c . causes a syntax error in Python. Methods Methods on objects are functions attached to the object s class the syntax instance.method argument is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method instance, argument . Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self or this in some other object oriented programming languages e.g., C++, Java, Objective C, or Ruby . Apart from this, Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores , to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more. Typing Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well defined for example, adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example, SpamClass or EggsClass , and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself , allowing metaprogramming and reflection. Before version . , Python had two kinds of classes old style and new style. The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type . In versions of Python from Python . onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old style classes were eliminated in Python . . The long term plan is to support gradual typing and from Python . , the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking. Arithmetic operations Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators +, , , , the floor division operator and the modulo operation where the remainder can be negative, e.g. . It also has for exponentiation, e.g. and . . , and a matrix multiplication operator . These operators work like in traditional math with the same precedence rules, the operators infix + and can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively . The division between integers produces floating point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time Current Python i.e. since . changed to always be floating point division, e.g. . . Python . changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. and . The floor division operator was introduced. So , , . . and . . . Adding from future import division causes a module to use Python . rules for division see next . Python . and earlier used C s division behavior. The operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards , e.g. and . In Python terms, is true division or simply division , and is floor division. before version . is classic division. Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation a + b b a b + is always true. It also means that the equation b a b + a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is, as expected, in the half open interval , b , where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval b, when b is negative. Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie breaking, Python uses round to even round . and round . both produce . Versions before used round away from zero round . is . , round . is . . Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C derived languages interpret this expression differently in C, the expression would first evaluate a b, resulting in or , and that result would then be compared with c. Python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers. Due to Python s extensive mathematics library, and the third party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation. Programming examples Hello world program print Hello, world Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer n int input Type a number, and its factorial will be printed if n raise ValueError You must enter a non negative integer factorial for i in range , n + factorial i print factorial Libraries Python s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface WSGI implementation wsgiref follows PEP , but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. As of September , the Python Package Index PyPI , the official repository for third party Python software, contains over , packages with a wide range of functionality, including Automation Data analytics Databases Documentation Graphical user interfaces Image processing Machine learning Mobile App Multimedia Computer networking Scientific computing System administration Test frameworks Text processing Web frameworks Web scraping Development environments See also Comparison of integrated development environments Python Most Python implementations including CPython include a read eval print loop REPL , permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser based IDEs SageMath intended for developing science and math related Python programs PythonAnywhere, a browser based IDE and hosting environment and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing. Implementations See also List of Python software Python implementations Reference implementation CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C standard with several select C features with later C versions out, it is considered outdated CPython includes its own C extensions, but third party extensions are not limited to older C versions, can e.g. be implemented with C or C++ . It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including Windows starting with Python . , the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows and Windows XP was supported until Python . and most modern Unix like systems, including macOS and Apple M Macs, since Python . . , with experimental installer and unofficial support for e.g. VMS. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities, during the Python and Python time frame, even OS and Solaris were supported support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. Other implementations PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python . and . . Its just in time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython but several libraries written in C cannot be used with it. Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version. MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python variants optimized for microcontrollers, including Lego Mindstorms EV . Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs. Cinder is a performance oriented fork of CPython . that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method at a time JIT and an experimental bytecode compiler. Unsupported implementations Other just in time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in , with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. Psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python . or later. PyS was a Python interpreter for Series mobile phones released by Nokia in . It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device. Cross compilers to other languages There are several compilers to high level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language Cython compiles a superset of Python . to C while the resulting code is also usable with Python and also e.g. C++ . Nuitka compiles Python into C++. Pythran compiles a subset of Python to C++. Pyrex latest release in and She Would Skin latest release in compile to C and C++ respectively. Google s Grumpy latest release in transpiles Python to Go. IronPython now abandoned by Microsoft allows running Python . programs on the .NET Common Language Runtime. Jython compiles Python . to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program. MyHDL is a Python based hardware description language HDL , that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code. Numba uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python to machine code. Brython, Transcrypt and Pyjs latest release in compile Python to JavaScript. RPython can be compiled to C, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python. Performance A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non numerical combinatorial workload was presented at EuroSciPy . Python s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game. Development Python s development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal PEP process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP . Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council. Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development. Specific issues are discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. Development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January . CPython s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented Backward incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently version . was released years after . . Major or feature releases, occurred about every months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with Python . are expected to happen once a year. They are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release. Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented. Many alpha, beta, and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development. The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as Pyladies. Python . deprecates wstr to be removed in Python . meaning Python extensions need to be modified by then , and also plans to add pattern matching to the language. API documentation generators Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc available as part of standard library , Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others. Naming Python s name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines. The prefix Py is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python commonly used to create games PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python. Popularity Since , Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, as of February , it is the third most popular language behind Java, and C . It was selected Programming Language of the Year for the highest rise in ratings in a year in , , , and the only language to do so four times . An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often better than Java and not much worse than C or C++ . Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo , CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python. stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog Here is a collection of resources on how to get started using Python. Getting started with Python In this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the Stack Overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. Up now, on our list Python. Python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our Developer Survey. In , . of respondents said they want to keep working with Python. Conceived in the late s, it is one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers Rust and TypeScript evidence that original designer Guido van Rossum got a lot right. Python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show, Monty Python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. While it is not primarily used for performance intensive programming, it is often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. This makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it is used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to VFX and AI. Some regard it as an ideal language for beginners many terms are expressed using English words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in Python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. History of use Trending tags on Stackoverflow.com Although Python has been around since the . release in , its usage has ballooned in recent years. Indeed, as our former data scientist David Robinson noted, since , it has risen above the five other major languages C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript and C in usage as estimated by the number of Stack Overflow question views per month. TIOBE s index ranks Python as third in popularity at . , rapidly gaining on C and Java . and . respectively . Today, of developers and technologists around the world are using Python. Until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person Dutch computer scientist Guido van Rossum, who stepped down as Python s Benevolent Dictator For Life in but has remained an active contributor to this day. Who is using it Python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that do not use it in some form. While it is not the language of choice for consumer applications like D games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use Python for tools and utilities. It is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example, in the VFX field, nearly all of the major software packages Maya, Ds Max, Houdini, Cinema D, Blender, and Nuke have embedded Python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. It is used more or less everywhere on Earth and, well, even on Mars. In fact, if you are reading this on a Mac, you already have Python installed on your computer just go to Terminal, type python , and away you go Who is it for Students The use of short English keywords instead of symbols makes Python particularly friendly for beginners. See the example below. Additionally, Python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you will spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like C++. It comes bundled with a free IDE integrated development environment , IDLE, so you can get started quickly. In case you are wondering, yes, IDLE is a reference to Monty Python s Eric Idle if you use Python you are going to be bombarded with references to vintage British comedy. Developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed While Python typically runs slower than other common languages like C++ or Java, it is often much quicker to write indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in Python is three to five times shorter than its Java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the C++ version. This is one of the reasons it is often used as a support language software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. For the same reason, it is also used for prototyping code can be hacked together quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. Developers working with text or numbers Python s powerful String and List manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. And it is a great tool for exploring data. The fact that it does not need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running Python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step by step, examining it at each stage. Python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of packages , many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. These include the venerable NumPy mathematical functions and data analysis , SciPy for science , Matplotlib data visualization and Pandas data analysis , and more recently TensorFlow and Keras Machine Learning AI , as well as tens of thousands of others. Web developers Another key area of Python use is backend development. It has built in support for common protocols like HTML, XML, and JSON, and frameworks like Django, Flask, and Bottle are used widely for example, Reddit s backend is Python. Python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. Why you should not learn it There is a lot to like about Python, but it is not always the perfect tool for the job. Perhaps most importantly, Python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like C++. While that means there is no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. So you are probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster FPS first person shooter in Python, but it is perfect for situations like data manipulation where you are likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. Additionally, Python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it is your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. For example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of English words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in Python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in Java or C++. However, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity. Key concepts The core philosophies are summarized in Pythonic fashion in The Zen Of Python. These include Readability counts Simple is better than complex There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it In case you were wondering, The Zen Of Python is available in catchy musical form here.

            "python programming language from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia python is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large scale projects. python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured particularly, procedural , object oriented and functional programming. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. guido van rossum began working on python in the late s, as a successor to the abc programming language, and first released it in as python . . . python . was released in and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. python . was released in and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. python was discontinued with version . . in . python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. history python was conceived in the late s by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde informatica cwi in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language, which was inspired by setl, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system. its implementation began in december . van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until july , when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as python s benevolent dictator for life , a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker. in january , active python core developers elected a five member steering council to lead the project. python . was released on october , with many major new features, including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for unicode. python . was released on december . it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. many of its major features were backported to python . .x and . .x version series. releases of python include the to utility, which automates the translation of python code to python . python . s end of life date was initially set at then postponed to out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to python . no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. with python s end of life, only python . .x and later are supported. python . . and . . were expedited as all versions of python including . had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning. design philosophy and features python is a multi paradigm programming language. object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming including by metaprogramming and metaobjects magic methods . many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management. it also features dynamic name resolution late binding , which binds method and variable names during program execution. python s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition. it has filter,mapandreduce functions list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. the standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml. the language s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python pep , which includes aphorisms such as beautiful is better than ugly. explicit is better than implicit. simple is better than complex. complex is better than complicated. readability counts. rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, python was designed to be highly extensible with modules . this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. van rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc, which espoused the opposite approach. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. python strives for a simpler, less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. in contrast to perl s there is more than one way to do it motto, python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it design philosophy. alex martelli, a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author, writes that to describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the python culture. python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. when speed is important, a python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c, or use pypy, a just in time compiler. cython is also available, which translates a python script into c and makes direct c level api calls into the python interpreter. python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. this is reflected in its name a tribute to the british comedy group monty python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs a reference to a monty python sketch instead of the standard foo and bar. a common neologism in the python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. in contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic. users and admirers of python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as pythonistas. syntax and semantics main article python syntax and semantics python is meant to be an easily readable language. its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation. unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal. indentation main article python syntax and semantics indentation python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. an increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. thus, the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure. this feature is sometimes termed the off side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. the recommended indent size is four spaces. statements and control flow python s statements include among others the assignment statement, using a single equals sign . the if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif a contraction of else if . the for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. the while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. the try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. the raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception. the class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object oriented programming. . the def statement, which defines a function or method. the with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it , allowing resource acquisition is initialization raii like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom. the break statement, exits from a loop. the continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. the del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will because an error. a deleted variable can be reassigned. the pass statement, which serves as a nop. it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. the assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. the yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. this form is used to implement coroutines. the return statement, used to return a value from a function. the import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. the assignment statement operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. in python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. however, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations, and, according to guido van rossum, it never will. however, better support for coroutine like functionality is provided, by extending python s generators. before . , generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. from python . , it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from python . , the information can be passed through multiple stack levels. expressions some python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java, while some are not addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. there are two types of divisions in python. they are floor division or integer division and floating point division. python also uses the operator for exponentiation. from python . , the new infix operator was introduced. it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication. from python . , the syntax , called the walrus operator was introduced. it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. in python, compares by value, versus java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals method. python s is operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference . in python, comparisons may be chained, for example a b c. python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic , , used in java and c. python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression. anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y different in order of operands from the c x y operator common to many other languages . python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. lists are written as , , , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in python . tuples are written as , , , are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. the + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. thus, given the variable t initially equal to , , , executing t t + , first evaluates t + , , which yields , , , , , which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively modifying the contents of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts. python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable, a writable property, etc. , are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. the statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. python has a string format operator . this functions analogously to printf format strings in c, e.g. spam s eggs d blah , evaluates to spam blah eggs . in python and . +, this was supplemented by the format method of the str class, e.g. spam eggs .format blah , . python . added f strings blah blah eggs f spam blah eggs eggs . strings in python can be concatenated, by adding them same operator as for adding integers and floats . e.g. spam + eggs returns spameggs . even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. e.g. + returns . python has various kinds of string literals strings delimited by single or double quote marks. unlike in unix shells, perl and perl influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. both kinds of string use the backslash as an escape character. string interpolation became available in python . as formatted string literals . triple quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, perl and ruby. raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and windows style paths. compare in c . python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a key , a start stop or a start stop step . indexes are zero based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. the third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns a copy of the entire list. each element of a slice is a shallow copy. in python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as common lisp, scheme, or ruby. this leads to duplicating some functionality. for example list comprehensions vs. for loops conditional expressions vs. if blocks the eval vs. exec built in functions in python , exec is a statement the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions if c . is syntactically valid but probably unintended c code but if c . causes a syntax error in python. methods methods on objects are functions attached to the object s class the syntax instance.method argument is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for class.method instance, argument . python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self or this in some other object oriented programming languages e.g., c++, java, objective c, or ruby . apart from this, python also provides methods, often called dunder methods due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores , to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more. typing python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. type constraints are not checked at compile time rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. despite being dynamically typed, python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well defined for example, adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object oriented programming. new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example, spamclass or eggsclass , and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself , allowing metaprogramming and reflection. before version . , python had two kinds of classes old style and new style. the syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type . in versions of python from python . onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. old style classes were eliminated in python . . the long term plan is to support gradual typing and from python . , the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, cpython. an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking. arithmetic operations python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators +, , , , the floor division operator and the modulo operation where the remainder can be negative, e.g. . it also has for exponentiation, e.g. and . . , and a matrix multiplication operator . these operators work like in traditional math with the same precedence rules, the operators infix + and can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively . the division between integers produces floating point results. the behavior of division has changed significantly over time current python i.e. since . changed to always be floating point division, e.g. . . python . changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. and . the floor division operator was introduced. so , , . . and . . . adding from future import division causes a module to use python . rules for division see next . python . and earlier used c s division behavior. the operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating point division otherwise. integer division rounds towards , e.g. and . in python terms, is true division or simply division , and is floor division. before version . is classic division. rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. for instance, it means that the equation a + b b a b + is always true. it also means that the equation b a b + a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. however, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is, as expected, in the half open interval , b , where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval b, when b is negative. python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. for tie breaking, python uses round to even round . and round . both produce . versions before used round away from zero round . is . , round . is . . python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. for example, the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. c derived languages interpret this expression differently in c, the expression would first evaluate a b, resulting in or , and that result would then be compared with c. python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations. the decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers. due to python s extensive mathematics library, and the third party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation. programming examples hello world program print hello, world program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer n int input type a number, and its factorial will be printed if n raise valueerror you must enter a non negative integer factorial for i in range , n + factorial i print factorial libraries python s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. for internet facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported. it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example, the web server gateway interface wsgi implementation wsgiref follows pep , but most modules are not. they are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. however, because most of the standard library is cross platform python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. as of september , the python package index pypi , the official repository for third party python software, contains over , packages with a wide range of functionality, including automation data analytics databases documentation graphical user interfaces image processing machine learning mobile app multimedia computer networking scientific computing system administration test frameworks text processing web frameworks web scraping development environments see also comparison of integrated development environments python most python implementations including cpython include a read eval print loop repl , permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. other shells, including idle and ipython, add further abilities such as improved auto completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. as well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are web browser based ides sagemath intended for developing science and math related python programs pythonanywhere, a browser based ide and hosting environment and canopy ide, a commercial python ide emphasizing scientific computing. implementations see also list of python software python implementations reference implementation cpython is the reference implementation of python. it is written in c, meeting the c standard with several select c features with later c versions out, it is considered outdated cpython includes its own c extensions, but third party extensions are not limited to older c versions, can e.g. be implemented with c or c++ . it compiles python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and native python. it is available for many platforms, including windows starting with python . , the python installer deliberately fails to install on windows and windows xp was supported until python . and most modern unix like systems, including macos and apple m macs, since python . . , with experimental installer and unofficial support for e.g. vms. platform portability was one of its earliest priorities, during the python and python time frame, even os and solaris were supported support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. other implementations pypy is a fast, compliant interpreter of python . and . . its just in time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython but several libraries written in c cannot be used with it. stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. pypy also has a stackless version. micropython and circuitpython are python variants optimized for microcontrollers, including lego mindstorms ev . pyston is a variant of the python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of python programs. cinder is a performance oriented fork of cpython . that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method at a time jit and an experimental bytecode compiler. unsupported implementations other just in time python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported google began a project named unladen swallow in , with the aim of speeding up the python interpreter fivefold by using the llvm, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. the emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard python code. psyco does not support python . or later. pys was a python interpreter for series mobile phones released by nokia in . it implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the symbian operating system. the nokia n also supports python with gtk widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device. cross compilers to other languages there are several compilers to high level object languages, with either unrestricted python, a restricted subset of python, or a language similar to python as the source language cython compiles a superset of python . to c while the resulting code is also usable with python and also e.g. c++ . nuitka compiles python into c++. pythran compiles a subset of python to c++. pyrex latest release in and she would skin latest release in compile to c and c++ respectively. google s grumpy latest release in transpiles python to go. ironpython now abandoned by microsoft allows running python . programs on the .net common language runtime. jython compiles python . to java bytecode, allowing the use of the java libraries from a python program. myhdl is a python based hardware description language hdl , that converts myhdl code to verilog or vhdl code. numba uses llvm to compile a subset of python to machine code. brython, transcrypt and pyjs latest release in compile python to javascript. rpython can be compiled to c, and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python. performance a performance comparison of various python implementations on a non numerical combinatorial workload was presented at euroscipy . python s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game. development python s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal pep process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions. python coding style is covered in pep . outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council. enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation. the mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development. specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running mercurial, until python moved to github in january . cpython s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented backward incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. the first part of the version number is incremented. these releases happen infrequently version . was released years after . . major or feature releases, occurred about every months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python . are expected to happen once a year. they are largely compatible but introduce new features. the second part of the version number is incremented. each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release. bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. the third and final part of the version number is incremented. many alpha, beta, and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development. the major academic conference on python is pycon. there are also special python mentoring programmes, such as pyladies. python . deprecates wstr to be removed in python . meaning python extensions need to be modified by then , and also plans to add pattern matching to the language. api documentation generators tools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc available as part of standard library , sphinx, pdoc and its forks, doxygen and graphviz, among others. naming python s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python, whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language. monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines. the prefix py is used to show that something is related to python. examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame, a binding of sdl to python commonly used to create games pyqt and pygtk, which bind qt and gtk to python respectively and pypy, a python implementation originally written in python. popularity since , python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where, as of february , it is the third most popular language behind java, and c . it was selected programming language of the year for the highest rise in ratings in a year in , , , and the only language to do so four times . an empirical study found that scripting languages, such as python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as c and java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often better than java and not much worse than c or c++ . large organizations that use python include wikipedia, google, yahoo , cern, nasa, facebook, amazon, instagram, spotify and some smaller entities like ilm and ita. the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python. stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog here is a collection of resources on how to get started using python. getting started with python in this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. up now, on our list python. python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey. in , . of respondents said they want to keep working with python. conceived in the late s, it is one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers rust and typescript evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right. python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show, monty python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. while it is not primarily used for performance intensive programming, it is often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it is used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai. some regard it as an ideal language for beginners many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. history of use trending tags on stackoverflow.com although python has been around since the . release in , its usage has ballooned in recent years. indeed, as our former data scientist david robinson noted, since , it has risen above the five other major languages c++, php, java, javascript and c in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month. tiobe s index ranks python as third in popularity at . , rapidly gaining on c and java . and . respectively . today, of developers and technologists around the world are using python. until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person dutch computer scientist guido van rossum, who stepped down as python s benevolent dictator for life in but has remained an active contributor to this day. who is using it python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that do not use it in some form. while it is not the language of choice for consumer applications like d games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities. it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example, in the vfx field, nearly all of the major software packages maya, ds max, houdini, cinema d, blender, and nuke have embedded python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. it is used more or less everywhere on earth and, well, even on mars. in fact, if you are reading this on a mac, you already have python installed on your computer just go to terminal, type python , and away you go who is it for students the use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners. see the example below. additionally, python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you will spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c++. it comes bundled with a free ide integrated development environment , idle, so you can get started quickly. in case you are wondering, yes, idle is a reference to monty python s eric idle if you use python you are going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy. developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed while python typically runs slower than other common languages like c++ or java, it is often much quicker to write indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c++ version. this is one of the reasons it is often used as a support language software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. for the same reason, it is also used for prototyping code can be hacked together quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. developers working with text or numbers python s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. and it is a great tool for exploring data. the fact that it does not need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step by step, examining it at each stage. python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of packages , many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. these include the venerable numpy mathematical functions and data analysis , scipy for science , matplotlib data visualization and pandas data analysis , and more recently tensorflow and keras machine learning ai , as well as tens of thousands of others. web developers another key area of python use is backend development. it has built in support for common protocols like html, xml, and json, and frameworks like django, flask, and bottle are used widely for example, reddit s backend is python. python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. why you should not learn it there is a lot to like about python, but it is not always the perfect tool for the job. perhaps most importantly, python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like c++. while that means there is no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. so you are probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster fps first person shooter in python, but it is perfect for situations like data manipulation where you are likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. additionally, python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it is your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. for example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of english words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c++. however, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity. key concepts the core philosophies are summarized in pythonic fashion in the zen of python. these include readability counts simple is better than complex there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it in case you were wondering, the zen of python is available in catchy musical form here. resources official the official tutorial is a quick primer on all the

            "python programming language from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia python is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large scale projects. python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured particularly, procedural , object oriented and functional programming. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. guido van rossum began working on python in the late s, as a successor to the abc programming language, and first released it in as python . . . python . was released in and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. python . was released in and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. python was discontinued with version . . in . python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. history python was conceived in the late s by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde informatica cwi in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language, which was inspired by setl, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system. its implementation began in december . van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until july , when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as python s benevolent dictator for life , a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker. in january , active python core developers elected a five member steering council to lead the project. python . was released on october , with many major new features, including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for unicode. python . was released on december . it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. many of its major features were backported to python . .x and . .x version series. releases of python include the to utility, which automates the translation of python code to python . python . s end of life date was initially set at then postponed to out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to python . no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. with python s end of life, only python . .x and later are supported. python . . and . . were expedited as all versions of python including . had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning. design philosophy and features python is a multi paradigm programming language. object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming including by metaprogramming and metaobjects magic methods . many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management. it also features dynamic name resolution late binding , which binds method and variable names during program execution. python s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition. it has filter,mapandreduce functions list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. the standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml. the language s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python pep , which includes aphorisms such as beautiful is better than ugly. explicit is better than implicit. simple is better than complex. complex is better than complicated. readability counts. rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, python was designed to be highly extensible with modules . this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. van rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc, which espoused the opposite approach. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. python strives for a simpler, less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. in contrast to perl s there is more than one way to do it motto, python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it design philosophy. alex martelli, a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author, writes that to describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the python culture. python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. when speed is important, a python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c, or use pypy, a just in time compiler. cython is also available, which translates a python script into c and makes direct c level api calls into the python interpreter. python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. this is reflected in its name a tribute to the british comedy group monty python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs a reference to a monty python sketch instead of the standard foo and bar. a common neologism in the python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. in contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic. users and admirers of python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as pythonistas. syntax and semantics main article python syntax and semantics python is meant to be an easily readable language. its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation. unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal. indentation main article python syntax and semantics indentation python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. an increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. thus, the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure. this feature is sometimes termed the off side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. the recommended indent size is four spaces. statements and control flow python s statements include among others the assignment statement, using a single equals sign . the if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif a contraction of else if . the for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. the while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. the try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. the raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception. the class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object oriented programming. . the def statement, which defines a function or method. the with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it , allowing resource acquisition is initialization raii like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom. the break statement, exits from a loop. the continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. the del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will because an error. a deleted variable can be reassigned. the pass statement, which serves as a nop. it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. the assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. the yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. this form is used to implement coroutines. the return statement, used to return a value from a function. the import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. the assignment statement operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. in python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. however, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations, and, according to guido van rossum, it never will. however, better support for coroutine like functionality is provided, by extending python s generators. before . , generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. from python . , it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from python . , the information can be passed through multiple stack levels. expressions some python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java, while some are not addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. there are two types of divisions in python. they are floor division or integer division and floating point division. python also uses the operator for exponentiation. from python . , the new infix operator was introduced. it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication. from python . , the syntax , called the walrus operator was introduced. it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. in python, compares by value, versus java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals method. python s is operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference . in python, comparisons may be chained, for example a b c. python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic , , used in java and c. python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression. anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y different in order of operands from the c x y operator common to many other languages . python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. lists are written as , , , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in python . tuples are written as , , , are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. the + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. thus, given the variable t initially equal to , , , executing t t + , first evaluates t + , , which yields , , , , , which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively modifying the contents of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts. python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable, a writable property, etc. , are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. the statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. python has a string format operator . this functions analogously to printf format strings in c, e.g. spam s eggs d blah , evaluates to spam blah eggs . in python and . +, this was supplemented by the format method of the str class, e.g. spam eggs .format blah , . python . added f strings blah blah eggs f spam blah eggs eggs . strings in python can be concatenated, by adding them same operator as for adding integers and floats . e.g. spam + eggs returns spameggs . even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. e.g. + returns . python has various kinds of string literals strings delimited by single or double quote marks. unlike in unix shells, perl and perl influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. both kinds of string use the backslash as an escape character. string interpolation became available in python . as formatted string literals . triple quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, perl and ruby. raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and windows style paths. compare in c . python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a key , a start stop or a start stop step . indexes are zero based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. the third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns a copy of the entire list. each element of a slice is a shallow copy. in python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as common lisp, scheme, or ruby. this leads to duplicating some functionality. for example list comprehensions vs. for loops conditional expressions vs. if blocks the eval vs. exec built in functions in python , exec is a statement the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions if c . is syntactically valid but probably unintended c code but if c . causes a syntax error in python. methods methods on objects are functions attached to the object s class the syntax instance.method argument is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for class.method instance, argument . python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self or this in some other object oriented programming languages e.g., c++, java, objective c, or ruby . apart from this, python also provides methods, often called dunder methods due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores , to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more. typing python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. type constraints are not checked at compile time rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. despite being dynamically typed, python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well defined for example, adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object oriented programming. new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example, spamclass or eggsclass , and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself , allowing metaprogramming and reflection. before version . , python had two kinds of classes old style and new style. the syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type . in versions of python from python . onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. old style classes were eliminated in python . . the long term plan is to support gradual typing and from python . , the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, cpython. an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking. arithmetic operations python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators +, , , , the floor division operator and the modulo operation where the remainder can be negative, e.g. . it also has for exponentiation, e.g. and . . , and a matrix multiplication operator . these operators work like in traditional math with the same precedence rules, the operators infix + and can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively . the division between integers produces floating point results. the behavior of division has changed significantly over time current python i.e. since . changed to always be floating point division, e.g. . . python . changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. and . the floor division operator was introduced. so , , . . and . . . adding from future import division causes a module to use python . rules for division see next . python . and earlier used c s division behavior. the operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating point division otherwise. integer division rounds towards , e.g. and . in python terms, is true division or simply division , and is floor division. before version . is classic division. rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. for instance, it means that the equation a + b b a b + is always true. it also means that the equation b a b + a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. however, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is, as expected, in the half open interval , b , where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval b, when b is negative. python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. for tie breaking, python uses round to even round . and round . both produce . versions before used round away from zero round . is . , round . is . . python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. for example, the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. c derived languages interpret this expression differently in c, the expression would first evaluate a b, resulting in or , and that result would then be compared with c. python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations. the decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers. due to python s extensive mathematics library, and the third party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation. programming examples hello world program print hello, world program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer n int input type a number, and its factorial will be printed if n raise valueerror you must enter a non negative integer factorial for i in range , n + factorial i print factorial libraries python s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. for internet facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported. it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example, the web server gateway interface wsgi implementation wsgiref follows pep , but most modules are not. they are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. however, because most of the standard library is cross platform python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. as of september , the python package index pypi , the official repository for third party python software, contains over , packages with a wide range of functionality, including automation data analytics databases documentation graphical user interfaces image processing machine learning mobile app multimedia computer networking scientific computing system administration test frameworks text processing web frameworks web scraping development environments see also comparison of integrated development environments python most python implementations including cpython include a read eval print loop repl , permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. other shells, including idle and ipython, add further abilities such as improved auto completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. as well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are web browser based ides sagemath intended for developing science and math related python programs pythonanywhere, a browser based ide and hosting environment and canopy ide, a commercial python ide emphasizing scientific computing. implementations see also list of python software python implementations reference implementation cpython is the reference implementation of python. it is written in c, meeting the c standard with several select c features with later c versions out, it is considered outdated cpython includes its own c extensions, but third party extensions are not limited to older c versions, can e.g. be implemented with c or c++ . it compiles python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and native python. it is available for many platforms, including windows starting with python . , the python installer deliberately fails to install on windows and windows xp was supported until python . and most modern unix like systems, including macos and apple m macs, since python . . , with experimental installer and unofficial support for e.g. vms. platform portability was one of its earliest priorities, during the python and python time frame, even os and solaris were supported support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. other implementations pypy is a fast, compliant interpreter of python . and . . its just in time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython but several libraries written in c cannot be used with it. stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. pypy also has a stackless version. micropython and circuitpython are python variants optimized for microcontrollers, including lego mindstorms ev . pyston is a variant of the python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of python programs. cinder is a performance oriented fork of cpython . that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method at a time jit and an experimental bytecode compiler. unsupported implementations other just in time python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported google began a project named unladen swallow in , with the aim of speeding up the python interpreter fivefold by using the llvm, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. the emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard python code. psyco does not support python . or later. pys was a python interpreter for series mobile phones released by nokia in . it implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the symbian operating system. the nokia n also supports python with gtk widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device. cross compilers to other languages there are several compilers to high level object languages, with either unrestricted python, a restricted subset of python, or a language similar to python as the source language cython compiles a superset of python . to c while the resulting code is also usable with python and also e.g. c++ . nuitka compiles python into c++. pythran compiles a subset of python to c++. pyrex latest release in and she would skin latest release in compile to c and c++ respectively. google s grumpy latest release in transpiles python to go. ironpython now abandoned by microsoft allows running python . programs on the .net common language runtime. jython compiles python . to java bytecode, allowing the use of the java libraries from a python program. myhdl is a python based hardware description language hdl , that converts myhdl code to verilog or vhdl code. numba uses llvm to compile a subset of python to machine code. brython, transcrypt and pyjs latest release in compile python to javascript. rpython can be compiled to c, and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python. performance a performance comparison of various python implementations on a non numerical combinatorial workload was presented at euroscipy . python s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game. development python s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal pep process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions. python coding style is covered in pep . outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council. enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation. the mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development. specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running mercurial, until python moved to github in january . cpython s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented backward incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. the first part of the version number is incremented. these releases happen infrequently version . was released years after . . major or feature releases, occurred about every months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python . are expected to happen once a year. they are largely compatible but introduce new features. the second part of the version number is incremented. each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release. bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. the third and final part of the version number is incremented. many alpha, beta, and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development. the major academic conference on python is pycon. there are also special python mentoring programmes, such as pyladies. python . deprecates wstr to be removed in python . meaning python extensions need to be modified by then , and also plans to add pattern matching to the language. api documentation generators tools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc available as part of standard library , sphinx, pdoc and its forks, doxygen and graphviz, among others. naming python s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python, whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language. monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines. the prefix py is used to show that something is related to python. examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame, a binding of sdl to python commonly used to create games pyqt and pygtk, which bind qt and gtk to python respectively and pypy, a python implementation originally written in python. popularity since , python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where, as of february , it is the third most popular language behind java, and c . it was selected programming language of the year for the highest rise in ratings in a year in , , , and the only language to do so four times . an empirical study found that scripting languages, such as python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as c and java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often better than java and not much worse than c or c++ . large organizations that use python include wikipedia, google, yahoo , cern, nasa, facebook, amazon, instagram, spotify and some smaller entities like ilm and ita. the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python. stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog here is a collection of resources on how to get started using python. getting started with python in this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. up now, on our list python. python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey. in , . of respondents said they want to keep working with python. conceived in the late s, it is one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers rust and typescript evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right. python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show, monty python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. while it is not primarily used for performance intensive programming, it is often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it is used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai. some regard it as an ideal language for beginners many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. history of use trending tags on stackoverflow.com although python has been around since the . release in , its usage has ballooned in recent years. indeed, as our former data scientist david robinson noted, since , it has risen above the five other major languages c++, php, java, javascript and c in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month. tiobe s index ranks python as third in popularity at . , rapidly gaining on c and java . and . respectively . today, of developers and technologists around the world are using python. until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person dutch computer scientist guido van rossum, who stepped down as python s benevolent dictator for life in but has remained an active contributor to this day. who is using it python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that do not use it in some form. while it is not the language of choice for consumer applications like d games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities. it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example, in the vfx field, nearly all of the major software packages maya, ds max, houdini, cinema d, blender, and nuke have embedded python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. it is used more or less everywhere on earth and, well, even on mars. in fact, if you are reading this on a mac, you already have python installed on your computer just go to terminal, type python , and away you go who is it for students the use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners. see the example below. additionally, python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you will spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c++. it comes bundled with a free ide integrated development environment , idle, so you can get started quickly. in case you are wondering, yes, idle is a reference to monty python s eric idle if you use python you are going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy. developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed while python typically runs slower than other common languages like c++ or java, it is often much quicker to write indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c++ version. this is one of the reasons it is often used as a support language software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. for the same reason, it is also used for prototyping code can be hacked together quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. developers working with text or numbers python s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. and it is a great tool for exploring data. the fact that it does not need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step by step, examining it at each stage. python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of packages , many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. these include the venerable numpy mathematical functions and data analysis , scipy for science , matplotlib data visualization and pandas data analysis , and more recently tensorflow and keras machine learning ai , as well as tens of thousands of others. web developers another key area of python use is backend development. it has built in support for common protocols like html, xml, and json, and frameworks like django, flask, and bottle are used widely for example, reddit s backend is python. python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. why you should not learn it there is a lot to like about python, but it is not always the perfect tool for the job. perhaps most importantly, python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like c++. while that means there is no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. so you are probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster fps first person shooter in python, but it is perfect for situations like data manipulation where you are likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. additionally, python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it is your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. for example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of english words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c++. however, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity. key concepts the core philosophies are summarized in pythonic fashion in the zen of python. these include readability counts simple is better than complex there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it in case you were wondering, the zen of python is available in catchy musical form here. resources official the official tutorial is a quick primer on all the

              "'python programming language from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia python is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language. its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. its language constructs as well as its object oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large scale projects. python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured particularly, procedural , object oriented and functional programming. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. guido van rossum began working on python in the late s, as a successor to the abc programming language, and first released it in as python . . . python . was released in and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. python . was released in and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. python was discontinued with version . . in . python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. history python was conceived in the late s by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde informatica cwi in the netherlands as a successor to abc programming language, which was inspired by setl, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system. its implementation began in december . van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until july , when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as python s benevolent dictator for life , a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker. in january , active python core developers elected a five member steering council to lead the project. python . was released on october , with many major new features, including a cycle detecting garbage collector and support for unicode. python . was released on december . it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. many of its major features were backported to python . .x and . .x version series. releases of python include the to utility, which automates the translation of python code to python . python . s end of life date was initially set at then postponed to out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to python . no more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. with python s end of life, only python . .x and later are supported. python . . and . . were expedited as all versions of python including . had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning. design philosophy and features python is a multi paradigm programming language. object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming including by metaprogramming and metaobjects magic methods . many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management. it also features dynamic name resolution late binding , which binds method and variable names during program execution. python s design offers some support for functional programming in the lisp tradition. it has filter,mapandreduce functions list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. the standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from haskell and standard ml. the language s core philosophy is summarized in the document the zen of python pep , which includes aphorisms such as beautiful is better than ugly. explicit is better than implicit. simple is better than complex. complex is better than complicated. readability counts. rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, python was designed to be highly extensible with modules . this compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. van rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with abc, which espoused the opposite approach. it is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. python strives for a simpler, less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. in contrast to perl s there is more than one way to do it motto, python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it design philosophy. alex martelli, a fellow at the python software foundation and python book author, writes that to describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the python culture. python s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non critical parts of the cpython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. when speed is important, a python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as c, or use pypy, a just in time compiler. cython is also available, which translates a python script into c and makes direct c level api calls into the python interpreter. python s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. this is reflected in its name a tribute to the british comedy group monty python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs a reference to a monty python sketch instead of the standard foo and bar. a common neologism in the python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. to say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. in contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic. users and admirers of python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as pythonistas. syntax and semantics main article python syntax and semantics python is meant to be an easily readable language. its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses english keywords where other languages use punctuation. unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. it has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than c or pascal. indentation main article python syntax and semantics indentation python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. an increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. thus, the program s visual structure accurately represents the program s semantic structure. this feature is sometimes termed the off side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation does not have any semantic meaning. the recommended indent size is four spaces. statements and control flow python s statements include among others the assignment statement, using a single equals sign . the if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif a contraction of else if . the for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. the while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. the try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. the raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception. the class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object oriented programming. . the def statement, which defines a function or method. the with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it , allowing resource acquisition is initialization raii like behavior and replaces a common try finally idiom. the break statement, exits from a loop. the continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item. the del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will because an error. a deleted variable can be reassigned. the pass statement, which serves as a nop. it is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. the assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply. the yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. this form is used to implement coroutines. the return statement, used to return a value from a function. the import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. the assignment statement operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. in python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and does not have a fixed data type associated with it. however, at a given time, a variable will refer to some object, which will have a type. this is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type. python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations, and, according to guido van rossum, it never will. however, better support for coroutine like functionality is provided, by extending python s generators. before . , generators were lazy iterators information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. from python . , it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from python . , the information can be passed through multiple stack levels. expressions some python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as c and java, while some are not addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. there are two types of divisions in python. they are floor division or integer division and floating point division. python also uses the operator for exponentiation. from python . , the new infix operator was introduced. it is intended to be used by libraries such as numpy for matrix multiplication. from python . , the syntax , called the walrus operator was introduced. it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. in python, compares by value, versus java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. value comparisons in java on objects can be performed with the equals method. python s is operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference . in python, comparisons may be chained, for example a b c. python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic , , used in java and c. python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression. anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression. conditional expressions in python are written as x if c else y different in order of operands from the c x y operator common to many other languages . python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. lists are written as , , , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in python . tuples are written as , , , are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. the + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. thus, given the variable t initially equal to , , , executing t t + , first evaluates t + , , which yields , , , , , which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively modifying the contents of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts. python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable, a writable property, etc. , are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. the statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. python has a string format operator . this functions analogously to printf format strings in c, e.g. spam s eggs d blah , evaluates to spam blah eggs . in python and . +, this was supplemented by the format method of the str class, e.g. spam eggs .format blah , . python . added f strings blah blah eggs f spam blah eggs eggs . strings in python can be concatenated, by adding them same operator as for adding integers and floats . e.g. spam + eggs returns spameggs . even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. e.g. + returns . python has various kinds of string literals strings delimited by single or double quote marks. unlike in unix shells, perl and perl influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. both kinds of string use the backslash as an escape character. string interpolation became available in python . as formatted string literals . triple quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. they may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, perl and ruby. raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and windows style paths. compare in c . python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a key , a start stop or a start stop step . indexes are zero based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. the third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns a copy of the entire list. each element of a slice is a shallow copy. in python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as common lisp, scheme, or ruby. this leads to duplicating some functionality. for example list comprehensions vs. for loops conditional expressions vs. if blocks the eval vs. exec built in functions in python , exec is a statement the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements. statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. a particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. this has the advantage of avoiding a classic c error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions if c . is syntactically valid but probably unintended c code but if c . causes a syntax error in python. methods methods on objects are functions attached to the object s class the syntax instance.method argument is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for class.method instance, argument . python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self or this in some other object oriented programming languages e.g., c++, java, objective c, or ruby . apart from this, python also provides methods, often called dunder methods due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores , to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations such as length, comparison, in arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more. typing python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. type constraints are not checked at compile time rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. despite being dynamically typed, python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well defined for example, adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object oriented programming. new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example, spamclass or eggsclass , and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself , allowing metaprogramming and reflection. before version . , python had two kinds of classes old style and new style. the syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly all new style classes inherit from object and are instances of type . in versions of python from python . onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. old style classes were eliminated in python . . the long term plan is to support gradual typing and from python . , the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, cpython. an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile time type checking. arithmetic operations python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators +, , , , the floor division operator and the modulo operation where the remainder can be negative, e.g. . it also has for exponentiation, e.g. and . . , and a matrix multiplication operator . these operators work like in traditional math with the same precedence rules, the operators infix + and can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively . the division between integers produces floating point results. the behavior of division has changed significantly over time current python i.e. since . changed to always be floating point division, e.g. . . python . changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. and . the floor division operator was introduced. so , , . . and . . . adding from future import division causes a module to use python . rules for division see next . python . and earlier used c s division behavior. the operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating point division otherwise. integer division rounds towards , e.g. and . in python terms, is true division or simply division , and is floor division. before version . is classic division. rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. for instance, it means that the equation a + b b a b + is always true. it also means that the equation b a b + a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. however, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is, as expected, in the half open interval , b , where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval b, when b is negative. python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. for tie breaking, python uses round to even round . and round . both produce . versions before used round away from zero round . is . , round . is . . python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. for example, the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. c derived languages interpret this expression differently in c, the expression would first evaluate a b, resulting in or , and that result would then be compared with c. python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations. the decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. the fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers. due to python s extensive mathematics library, and the third party library numpy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation. programming examples hello world program print hello, world program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer n int input type a number, and its factorial will be printed if n raise valueerror you must enter a non negative integer factorial for i in range , n + factorial i print factorial libraries python s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. for internet facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported. it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example, the web server gateway interface wsgi implementation wsgiref follows pep , but most modules are not. they are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. however, because most of the standard library is cross platform python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. as of september , the python package index pypi , the official repository for third party python software, contains over , packages with a wide range of functionality, including automation data analytics databases documentation graphical user interfaces image processing machine learning mobile app multimedia computer networking scientific computing system administration test frameworks text processing web frameworks web scraping development environments see also comparison of integrated development environments python most python implementations including cpython include a read eval print loop repl , permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately. other shells, including idle and ipython, add further abilities such as improved auto completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. as well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are web browser based ides sagemath intended for developing science and math related python programs pythonanywhere, a browser based ide and hosting environment and canopy ide, a commercial python ide emphasizing scientific computing. implementations see also list of python software python implementations reference implementation cpython is the reference implementation of python. it is written in c, meeting the c standard with several select c features with later c versions out, it is considered outdated cpython includes its own c extensions, but third party extensions are not limited to older c versions, can e.g. be implemented with c or c++ . it compiles python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. cpython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of c and native python. it is available for many platforms, including windows starting with python . , the python installer deliberately fails to install on windows and windows xp was supported until python . and most modern unix like systems, including macos and apple m macs, since python . . , with experimental installer and unofficial support for e.g. vms. platform portability was one of its earliest priorities, during the python and python time frame, even os and solaris were supported support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms. other implementations pypy is a fast, compliant interpreter of python . and . . its just in time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over cpython but several libraries written in c cannot be used with it. stackless python is a significant fork of cpython that implements microthreads it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. pypy also has a stackless version. micropython and circuitpython are python variants optimized for microcontrollers, including lego mindstorms ev . pyston is a variant of the python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of python programs. cinder is a performance oriented fork of cpython . that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method at a time jit and an experimental bytecode compiler. unsupported implementations other just in time python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported google began a project named unladen swallow in , with the aim of speeding up the python interpreter fivefold by using the llvm, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with cpython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. the emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard python code. psyco does not support python . or later. pys was a python interpreter for series mobile phones released by nokia in . it implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the symbian operating system. the nokia n also supports python with gtk widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device. cross compilers to other languages there are several compilers to high level object languages, with either unrestricted python, a restricted subset of python, or a language similar to python as the source language cython compiles a superset of python . to c while the resulting code is also usable with python and also e.g. c++ . nuitka compiles python into c++. pythran compiles a subset of python to c++. pyrex latest release in and she would skin latest release in compile to c and c++ respectively. google s grumpy latest release in transpiles python to go. ironpython now abandoned by microsoft allows running python . programs on the .net common language runtime. jython compiles python . to java bytecode, allowing the use of the java libraries from a python program. myhdl is a python based hardware description language hdl , that converts myhdl code to verilog or vhdl code. numba uses llvm to compile a subset of python to machine code. brython, transcrypt and pyjs latest release in compile python to javascript. rpython can be compiled to c, and is used to build the pypy interpreter of python. performance a performance comparison of various python implementations on a non numerical combinatorial workload was presented at euroscipy . python s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by the computer language benchmarks game. development python s development is conducted largely through the python enhancement proposal pep process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting python design decisions. python coding style is covered in pep . outstanding peps are reviewed and commented on by the python community and the steering council. enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the cpython reference implementation. the mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development. specific issues are discussed in the roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running mercurial, until python moved to github in january . cpython s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented backward incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. the first part of the version number is incremented. these releases happen infrequently version . was released years after . . major or feature releases, occurred about every months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with python . are expected to happen once a year. they are largely compatible but introduce new features. the second part of the version number is incremented. each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release. bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. the third and final part of the version number is incremented. many alpha, beta, and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development. the major academic conference on python is pycon. there are also special python mentoring programmes, such as pyladies. python . deprecates wstr to be removed in python . meaning python extensions need to be modified by then , and also plans to add pattern matching to the language. api documentation generators tools that can generate documentation for python api include pydoc available as part of standard library , sphinx, pdoc and its forks, doxygen and graphviz, among others. naming python s name is derived from the british comedy group monty python, whom python creator guido van rossum enjoyed while developing the language. monty python references appear frequently in python code and culture for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. the official python documentation also contains various references to monty python routines. the prefix py is used to show that something is related to python. examples of the use of this prefix in names of python applications or libraries include pygame, a binding of sdl to python commonly used to create games pyqt and pygtk, which bind qt and gtk to python respectively and pypy, a python implementation originally written in python. popularity since , python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the tiobe programming community index where, as of february , it is the third most popular language behind java, and c . it was selected programming language of the year for the highest rise in ratings in a year in , , , and the only language to do so four times . an empirical study found that scripting languages, such as python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as c and java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often better than java and not much worse than c or c++ . large organizations that use python include wikipedia, google, yahoo , cern, nasa, facebook, amazon, instagram, spotify and some smaller entities like ilm and ita. the social news networking site reddit was written mostly in python. stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog stackoverflow blog here is a collection of resources on how to get started using python. getting started with python in this series, we look at the most loved languages according to the stack overflow developer survey, examine the spread and use cases for each of them, and collect some essential links on how to get started using the language. up now, on our list python. python is consistently featured amongst the top most loved languages in our developer survey. in , . of respondents said they want to keep working with python. conceived in the late s, it is one of the older languages on our list, coming just below newcomers rust and typescript evidence that original designer guido van rossum got a lot right. python s quirky name in honor of the cult comedy show, monty python belies the fact that this is a hugely expressive language. while it is not primarily used for performance intensive programming, it is often highly efficient to write, and programs tend to be clear and readable. this makes it ideally suited for applications like data science and web development, and it is used in a wide range of fields, from healthcare and finance to vfx and ai. some regard it as an ideal language for beginners many terms are expressed using english words rather than symbols, its strict rules about whitespace mean all programs are visually consistent, and code written in python is often more concise than the equivalent in other languages. history of use trending tags on stackoverflow.com although python has been around since the . release in , its usage has ballooned in recent years. indeed, as our former data scientist david robinson noted, since , it has risen above the five other major languages c++, php, java, javascript and c in usage as estimated by the number of stack overflow question views per month. tiobe s index ranks python as third in popularity at . , rapidly gaining on c and java . and . respectively . today, of developers and technologists around the world are using python. until recently the language design and development was lead by a single person dutch computer scientist guido van rossum, who stepped down as python s benevolent dictator for life in but has remained an active contributor to this day. who is using it python is more or less ubiquitous it would be faster to list industries that do not use it in some form. while it is not the language of choice for consumer applications like d games or mobile apps, even companies developing these applications frequently use python for tools and utilities. it is also commonly embedded into software products for automation and scripting purposes for example, in the vfx field, nearly all of the major software packages maya, ds max, houdini, cinema d, blender, and nuke have embedded python interpreters, allowing users to add functionality or automate tasks. it is used more or less everywhere on earth and, well, even on mars. in fact, if you are reading this on a mac, you already have python installed on your computer just go to terminal, type python , and away you go who is it for students the use of short english keywords instead of symbols makes python particularly friendly for beginners. see the example below. additionally, python handles a lot of memory management automatically, so you will spend less time dealing with pointers and references and so on than in a language like c++. it comes bundled with a free ide integrated development environment , idle, so you can get started quickly. in case you are wondering, yes, idle is a reference to monty python s eric idle if you use python you are going to be bombarded with references to vintage british comedy. developers who prioritize ease of programming over execution speed while python typically runs slower than other common languages like c++ or java, it is often much quicker to write indeed, some estimates suggest a typical program in python is three to five times shorter than its java equivalent and five to ten times shorter than the c++ version. this is one of the reasons it is often used as a support language software developers rely on it for tasks like build control, automated testing, and bug tracking. for the same reason, it is also used for prototyping code can be hacked together quickly to test ideas, before perhaps rewriting in a more performant language. developers working with text or numbers python s powerful string and list manipulation functions make it a great choice for anyone working with text or numbers. and it is a great tool for exploring data. the fact that it does not need compiling means you can rapidly iterate on a program, and, by running python interactively, you can intuitively manipulate data step by step, examining it at each stage. python s core functionality can be extended with a huge arsenal of packages , many of which are widely used by the scientific and academic communities, as well as fintech and engineering. these include the venerable numpy mathematical functions and data analysis , scipy for science , matplotlib data visualization and pandas data analysis , and more recently tensorflow and keras machine learning ai , as well as tens of thousands of others. web developers another key area of python use is backend development. it has built in support for common protocols like html, xml, and json, and frameworks like django, flask, and bottle are used widely for example, reddit s backend is python. python powers advanced content management, email automation, and more. why you should not learn it there is a lot to like about python, but it is not always the perfect tool for the job. perhaps most importantly, python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language like c++. while that means there is no sitting around waiting for your code to compile, it also means the computer has to do extra work every time the program runs, inherently limiting performance. so you are probably not going to be writing the next blockbuster fps first person shooter in python, but it is perfect for situations like data manipulation where you are likely to spend more time writing the program than running it. additionally, python s somewhat unusual syntax means that if it is your first language not all of the knowledge you gain will be transferable to other languages, although many of the underlying concepts are identical. for example, the reduced reliance on brackets and braces, the use of english words instead of symbols, and the enforced usage of whitespace mean that a program in python may be visually structured in a very different way to the equivalent code in java or c++. however, these downsides are often a small price to pay for the many benefits, as evidenced by its ubiquity. key concepts the core philosophies are summarized in pythonic fashion in the zen of python. these include readability counts simple is better than complex there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it in case you were wondering, the zen of python is available in catchy musical form here. resources official the official tutorial is a quick primer on all the
