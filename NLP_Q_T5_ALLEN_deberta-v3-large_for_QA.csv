['Who is the person who wrote the algorithm?'],['programmer'],"[' this principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions,  where the programmer writes each instruction in a numeric form the hardware can execute directly,  these served to make the program much more humanreadable and relieved the programmer of tedious and errorprone address calculations,  rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer,  languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem,  usually unchecked casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types,  relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations,  the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions for example,  dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions, it may seem odd to some professional programmers that c could be ""weakly,  the need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmers,  programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity,  programmers may simply differ in their tastes they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language,  features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions,  because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer,  their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer,  and cannot ""understand"" what code the programmer intended to write,  a programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation,  programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs,  one language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours,  it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation']",a programmer," a programmer,"
['What is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs?'],['programming'],"['a programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs,  most programming languages are textbased formal languages,  the description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax form and semantics meaning,  the c programming language is specified by an iso standard while other languages such as perl have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference,  programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design,  and classification of programming languages,  definitions there are many considerations when defining what constitutes a programming language,  computer languages vs programming languages the term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language,  one usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages,  markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming,  the majority of practical programming languages are turing complete,  yet are often called programming languages,  some authors restrict the term ""programming language"" to turing complete languages, another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines,  reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution,  he also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages,  and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats,  a programming language involves a computer consequently,  programming languages are usually defined and studied this way,  programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people,  while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines,  are not usually considered programming languages,  programming languages may,  abstractions programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution,  the practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle,  machine languages were later termed firstgeneration programming languages gl,  the next step was the development of the socalled secondgeneration programming languages gl or assembly languages,  the first highlevel programming languages,  or thirdgeneration programming languages gl,  an early highlevel programming language to be designed for a computer was plankalkül,  as a programming language,  the first code and compiler was developed in for the mark computer at the university of manchester and is considered to be the first compiled highlevel programming language,  it was the first widely used highlevel general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, another early programming language was devised by grace hopper in the us,  she and her team wrote a specification for an english programming language and implemented a prototype,  refinement the increased use of highlevel languages introduced a requirement for lowlevel programming languages or system programming languages,  the period from the s to the late s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in use apl introduced array programming and influenced functional programming,  algol refined both structured procedural programming and the discipline of language specification the ""revised report on the algorithmic language algol "" became a model for how later language specifications were written,  was the first dynamically typed functional programming language,  simula was the first language designed to support objectoriented programming in the mid s,  c was developed between and as a system programming language for the unix operating system and remains popular,  was the first logic programming language,  pioneering statically typed functional programming languages,  and most modern programming languages count at least one of them in their ancestry,  the s and s also saw considerable debate over the merits of structured programming,  and whether programming languages should be designed to support it,  argued that goto statements should be eliminated from all ""higher level"" programming languages,  c++ combined objectoriented and systems programming,  a systems programming language derived from pascal and intended for use by defense contractors,  vast sums were spent investigating the socalled ""fifthgeneration"" languages that incorporated logic programming constructs,  one important trend in language design for programming largescale systems during the s was an increased focus on the use of modules or largescale organizational units of code,  which were often wedded to generic programming constructs,  java came to be used for serverside programming,  they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms although their syntax was often based on the c family of programming languages,  programming language evolution continues,  fourthgeneration programming languages gl are computer programming languages that aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than gls,  fifthgeneration programming languages gl are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program,  elements all programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection,  syntax a programming language\'s surface form is known as its syntax,  most programming languages are purely textual they use sequences of text including words,  there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature,  programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions for lexical structure and backus–naur form for grammatical structure,  the grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the chomsky hierarchy,  the syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a type grammar,  newer programming languages like java and c# have definite assignment analysis,  a significant amount of academic research went into formal semantics of programming languages,  results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia,  type system a type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types,  and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed,  some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types for example,  but they can mask programming errors,  standard library and runtime system most programming languages have an associated core library sometimes known as the \'standard library\',  design and implementation programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication,  a significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety since it has a precise and finite definition,  they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has,  many programming languages have been designed from scratch,  although there have been attempts to design one ""universal"" programming language that serves all purposes,  the need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmers, one common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of abstraction,  the earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer,  as new programming languages have developed,  natural language programming has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming,  and dismissed natural language programming as ""foolish"",  a language\'s designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming,  specification the specification of a programming language is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language,  a programming language specification can take several forms,  implementation an implementation of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software,  two approaches to programming language implementation compilation and interpretation,  proprietary languages although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations,  many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor,  proprietary programming languages are commonly domain specific languages or internal scripting languages for a single product some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor,  some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open for example,  oracle corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the java programming language,  and microsoft\'s c# programming language,  erlang was originally an ericsson\'s internal programming language,  use thousands of different programming languages have been created,  individual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more, programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness,  which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language,  a programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data,  programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs,  measuring language usage determining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context, com reported the ten most popular programming languages as in descending order by overall popularity java,  flavors and implementations a dialect of a programming language or a data exchange language is a relatively small variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature,  the basic programming language has many dialects,  taxonomies there is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages,  a given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language,  programming languages divide into programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use,  with generalpurpose programming languages distinguished from domainspecific programming languages,  programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences,  these are generally called imperative programming languages,  a great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer,  which is the main feature of declarative programming,  more refined paradigms include procedural programming,  objectoriented programming,  functional programming,  and logic programming some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multiparadigmatic,  programming languages might be considered general purpose,  system programming languages, a programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm,  most programming languages use english language
