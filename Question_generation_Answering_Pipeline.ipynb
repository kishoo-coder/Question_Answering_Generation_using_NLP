They are noted for their use of spoken word primarily in lieu of sung vocals, as well as their unconventional lyrics. Their musical stylings have been compared to Wire, Magazine and Joy Division.[4] The band released their debut single, 'Magic of Meghan' in 2019. Shaw wrote the song after going through a break-up and moving out of her former partner's apartment the same day that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry announced they were engaged.[5] This was followed by the release of two EPs that year: Sweet Princess in August and Boundary Road Snacks and Drinks in October. The band were included as part of the NME 100 of 2020,[6] as well as DIY magazine's Class of 2020.[7] The band signed to 4AD in late 2020 and shared a new single, 'Scratchcard Lanyard'.[8] In February 2021, the band shared details of their debut studio album, New Long Leg. They also shared the single 'Strong Feelings'.[9] The album, which was produced by John Parish, was released on 2 April 2021.[10]\"\n",
